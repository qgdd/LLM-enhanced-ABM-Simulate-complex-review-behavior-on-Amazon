B000YXC2LI,,These jeans fit verywell and are tight In all the right places and give just enough to not rub anywhere or ever be uncomfortable. Need a pair of nice white Jeans for an event these are priced right and fit very well.,5,Wear em In Comfort
B000YXC2LI,100.0,"If I had wanted blue burlap sack, I would have looked for it. Levi now thinks they can flog off any material on their customer. The last time I ordered these levis I got something in stripes that looked like I was escaped from prison. Now it is burlap! I will never order anything from Levi again until they come back to the original levi material. What complete junk. This product sucks.",1,New material
B000YXC2LI,12.0,"Although advertised as pre-shrunk, these continue to shrink drastically, and the wrinkles are hideous.  Got two different colors, same results.  Ordered the 517's as well, and they stayed true to fit without the wrinkles.",1,Other Levi choices are better
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I normally don't do reviews, but this time I have something helpful to say so I thought I'd share it.  The Verde Rigid is actually a Shrink to Fit jean and is not ""Pre Shrunk"" like it says here on Amazon. I bought my normal size, 30x30, washed it gentle cycle in cold water and dried in low heat. It came out super shrunk!!

Then I looked online and found this:

Made with rigid denim that you wash to a perfect fit and finish. Keep it dark and clean by washing as little as possible, or fade it with gentle washing. Will shrink approximately 10 percent; size up 1"" if waist is between 27""- 36"", size up 2"" if waist is between 38""- 48"". Increase length by 3"".

But since I am really a 30x30 and they don't make 31x33, I debated whether I should go 31x32 or 31x34. They also said somewhere if you wear boots, add an extra inch, so it would be 31x34. I don't wear boots and I wear these jeans when I ride my bike, so I decided to get 31x32. I hope they turn out cool.

Oh also, I called Amazon, and they were totally cool with it and issued me a full refund although I washed the jeans and it shrunk like crazy. They need to move this to the Shrink to Fit section.

Also, even though these jeans shrunk like crazy, they still kinda fit although they are kinda short in the inseam. They fit kinda tight, but the quality is great! They are super rigid and durable, I've never had a pair of jeans like this! I read somewhere that when you get your jeans, you should shrink them by taking off the tags, putting them on, and getting into a bathtub full of hot/cold water (depending on color of jeans and extent of fade you want). You sit there for about 30 minutes and when you get out, the water should be all blue and you will have a custom fitting jean! I will try that on my next pair instead of throwing them into the washer and dryer. Because I left them in the dryer for 2 days, they came out super wrinkly and they stay that way!! It's better for them to conform to your legs than all your other clothes in your dryer!",5,"5 Star Quality, but these are Shrink to Fit!! (Verde Rigid)"
B000YXC2LI,5.0,"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

It finally occurred to me to try the obvious, and check out the men's department instead. I'm overjoyed to discover that men's standard Levi's 501s fit me just fine, and look the way I expect jeans to look. They have pockets, and belt loops big enough to fit a normal belt, and legs that reach all the way down to my shoes. Hooray.",5,The quintessence of pants

For example the iconic rigid and new metal colors are extremely hard to find and they look extremely great. I picked a pair of both of these colors and got them for a great deal.

B000YXC2LI,,"The 501 shrink-to-fit, button-fly jeans have undergone some radical changes. The pocket socks are shallower and the material thinner. The denim is not as heavy, and the once durable stitching is now a hit and miss operation. The structure of the 501 has changed. Gone are the engineered (7) traditional belt loops, which now number only (5). Only one back-centered belt loop exists now, leaving an 8-inch span between the belt loops on either side. Note pic. The black Levis are from 1997, and the blue Levis are from 2018.

postscript: The black 1997 Levi's (w/ black stitching mind you, not the ""Filipino"" orange/gold stitching of today's versions) are 33 x 36 and fit perfectly. I just ordered a 501, shrink-to-fit Rigid Blue pair in 34 x34, and as expected, Levi changed their sizing, so if you want them to fit, then order one size larger than normal in the waist, and the next size shorter in length than you would usually order in a 501. They're a little baggie in the seat now, but far from the ""marble bagger's"" of their size 33 waist offered today. So, waist size up, and length-down and you might be happy. Levi's still are missing the two back belt loops, so cut some off of an old pair and have them sewn-on like I did. Boy Howdy. Hoop jumping to buy Levi's. Sad.",3,SAD

B000YXC2LI,15.0,"This is basically about overall quality.  Over the years I have watched the quality decline in every aspect.

Inconsistent workmanship.  One used to be able to count on one pair of jeans being the same as previous pairs.  Not the case anymore.  In my last three orders of multiple pairs of 501s, items in the same order were inconsistent.

The fabric gets thinner every year.

Right rear pocket attachment point develops a hole over a short period of time.  I do not carry anything in that pocket.

A pair of Levi's would last years.  Six months is considered amazing with today's product.

These are made in more countries that I can begin to count with some of the worst quality control and workmanship that I could document using ISO9000 standards.

Bottom line.  Overpriced junk.  This is the last time I will deal with this company who was based on quality in the past but has lost their commitment to the primary factor that made them great.  Time to try Wrangler once again next go around.  Ordered them in the past and went back to Levi's after the thinner material seemed cheap.  This latest Levi order makes Wrangler look more attractive with the latest, additional decline, in Levi quality.",1,After over six decades of being a Levi's fan it's time to call it quits

Levi's has myriad different levels of quality, now. 501's are *not* what they were when one could only buy the ""raw"" cloth type, and had to wash 'em five times before they were comfortable.

He was asking for new jeans for awhile, and he hadn't had a good, decent pair of Levis in so long. As soon as he opened these he put them on and said ""These feel the same as the ones I had when I was 18"" and THAT is why I got them, for that reaction. Levis are such a great brand, the 501's are a classic, thoughtful gift to any hard working Dad like mine who deserve that kind of nostalgia",5,"Classic Fit, Reliable Brand"

However, I think my daughter's American Girl Doll jeans are better quality (and cost less) than these. The material is thin, looks cheap and is scattered with snags and small holes. The stitching is poor and uneven and some of it is green. Why is it green??? The crotch has an unfortunately awkward cut, and there are only FOUR flimsy buttons in the fly (including the waist button).  Even the red tag is sad and misplaced.

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"UPDATE - Yeah these are garbage.  They are Levi's in name only and don't carry the quality you'd expect.  These are going back and my hunt to find a reputable denim company to replace my 505s continues!!  I'm only rating 1 star so i can leave a review.  Otherwise they should pay me for the time I've taken out of my day to review their garbage.

I'm not impressed at all with these 501s.  Normally I wear 505s and when I say normally I mean I have 1 good pair of jeans that i wear regularly, they are old, they are ""broken in"" and they are Levi's 505s.  I've lost some weight recently so i decided to purchase a new pair of Levi's and went with the classic 501s.  Wow the quality seems to have really taken a dive.

These Jeans are stiff.  No, not like new jean stiff.  I'm talking I could stand them up on their own without any support.  While unfolding them I joking thought to myself ""these jeans are so stiff they might crack!"".  Stiffness aside, the jean material feels much cheaper than my previous pair which have been worn hundreds of times and is still a much better quality than these brand new 501s.

I've washed them twice in a effort to get off the extra die and to try and loosen them up.  They still feel crunchy and stuff.  I'm going to wear them around a couple hours to see if them relax and break-in at all.  If not, these are heading back.",1,Skip Levi's and go with another brand ... the quality is really down the tubes

B000YXC2LI,,"I've been wearing Levi's since I could fit into them. They were the jeans back when I was a kid. I was so sick of Sears Toughskins because they had the reinforced knees that looked like somebody had stuffed a piece of cardboard in there. They screamed ""Your Mom is Practical!"" Levi's, on the other hand, were cool. It was what the hippies and fishermen wore. I'm talking about the early 1970s in Alaska. I grew up in that alternative lifestyle, one where if you wore a sport jacket, it was used. And you wore a paisley shirt, maybe some work boots. You rolled your own cigarettes and the other stuff, too. So anyway, I'm a fan. I remember wearing Levi's to work everyday as a reporter at the Anchorage Times, may that great paper rest in peace. And I still wear them, except now I work for a rural weekly waiting for technology and the economy to send all us old reporters out to pasture. Of course, I also wear slacks, LL Bean khakis. But the Levi fit is second to none. I tried Lee again but was dissatisfied. Higher waisted. Baggier. I had some Lees that rocked back in fourth grade but got battery acid all over them and they disintegrated. Batteries die at 30 below zero and you have to muscle them inside to warm and charge. I wore the same size 501s for years. I'd wash them several times so they'd soften. But now I'm old and wider. I wear 36 waist and 34 inseam. I wear a belt.

And last about as long if you still work hard for your living, But now that industrial hemp is again allowed to be grown the Original Version could be brought back.

All my other pairs fit fine so it is not the post Thanksgiving swelling. I will never buy Levis online again. If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear. I wouldn't expect them to last more than a few months of washing because of how thin they are made. I am wholeheartedly saddened if this is the quality that Levis has sunken  to.

Recently I decided to splurge and get a pair of Levi's. They looked great and fit great. Since they were my ""fancy"" jeans, I did not wear them for yard work or anything, just two days sitting at a desk and one wash every week.

Imagine my surprise when, after six weeks, the belt loop failed! About two weeks after the return window closed.

I suppose I will figure out some way to patch them, but they sure aren't my ""fancy"" jeans any longer.

I thought I could buy more expensive (assuming higher quality) stuff and buy and discard it less often, have better stuff and help the environment a little. However, in the case of jeans, it looks like I need to buy the cheapest acceptable product and replace it frequently, treating it more like a consumable, Oh well, Wrangler, here I come...",2,Others have something like a belt loop failure after 6-12 months

Now that I am going with a more metropolitan style, it is hard to find jeans that are long enough in any brand except Levis.  These seem to fit a little lower around the waist than I remember (but maybe they're the same) and are a little lighter, but they fit well and look nice.  I like them.  I'm 6' 2"" and weight about 185.  In dress pants I wear 34 inch waist - not sure the length as I get dress pants tailored.  Ordered a second pair of 501s after getting the first.

B000YXC2LI,3.0,"501's used to come so stiff due the thickness of the fabric you had to wash them 20 times to get them to loosen up so yer legs could bend.  These showed up like I'd already had 'em for a year.  The waist is fine but I ordered a 36 inch inseam which is exactly what the rear hip label says.  However, that isn't the case.  The inseam seemed a little short as my other 36"" inseam Levis are much longer...you guessed it...I measured the inseam...33 1/2"".  Now that's OK because they'll work with sneaks or boat shoes. but too short for boots.  I realize what I got sent DID state they were the correct size.  I'd order another pair but I need to know I'll get the correct length.  How do we make that happen?

However, when I received the most recent pair, I found more quality issues. In this case the back pockets were sewn on so low that they are on the leg of the pants! The 501 jeans are supposed to be low rise but these reach much higher.

Apparently the Levi company closed their US production plants and now manufactures their jeans in Asia and Mexico. The result seems to be slipping quality control. The pair I received were produced in Mexico, however other reviewers have had similar complaints about jeans made in Asia. I highly recommend buying these in a store where they can be checked for quality and fit. For at least the first 20 years of buying these, I simply grabbed them off the shelf in my size and never had to worry about trying them on. I knew they were what I had been buying all along. Unfortunately those days seem to be over when it comes to buying Levi's jeans, at least online.",3,"Levi, what happened to you?"

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"Bought a 501 Rinse 40/30; received an Egypt made pair that's not even close to being a 40, at best a 36. Rough around the edges, badly finished...

I had bought Levi's before here on amazon, on the big famous auction site and on different brick and mortar stores around the world and I had never seen a pair like these.

I wish I could return them, but I had them forwarded from the USA to my country and sending them back would cost more than buying them again. An absolute waste of money :-(

I attach photos to compare this 40/30 to a rarely used 36/30 made in Mxico (same size!) and a 38/30 also made in Mxico but with a bit more use (the Amazon-purchased 40 looks like 4 sizes smaller than the 38!!!)",1,Made in Egypt.... for aliens or something.

B000YXC2LI,,"Ok I didn't even know they still made Levi 501's! Let me begin at the start. I was diagnosed with advanced stage IV cancer and I was told to fatten up as much as humanly possible or risk dying from the very aggressive daily regimens of radioactive & chemotherapy which would eventually cause me to despise food to the point of not eating a thing for 2 1/2 months! My lead oncologists team of physicians all pleaded with me to begin eating anything or suffer having tubes surgically implanted into my stomach for nutrition. So cut to now, I survived my therapy but not without coming way too close to death due to lack of nutrition as well as the lack of use of my digestive system. Now I seem to be able to eat whatever, whenever and I still can't keep the weight on. This has been both a curse and a blessing. The curse is of course for obvious reasons but the benefits have been wearing clothes that I never thought I'd be able to pull off let alone put on ever again! I'm wearing sizes that my body hasn't seen or felt in 25years. My wife and I have an inside joke that keeps the seriousness of what we've been going through together due to cancer and it centers around the fact that although I'm far from being out of the woods due to this deadly killer, I'm not looking like one would think after gaining all that extra weight, almost dying three times, having visible signs of radiation burns on the exterior of my skin and then losing all the weight. I'm not being conceited but I look like I did at 24years old and am wearing the same sized clothing, especially in the area of my waist, so buying new pants and having them fit comfortably as well as look great is definitely an ego boost! So the joke is, I'm the poster boy for cancer because it agrees with me lol anyway thank you for reading this far into my rant as it's turned out rather than a review. The Levis 501's feel great! They fit as perfectly as they did when I wore them for the first time back in the 80's Dont pass up a chance to get a great pair of jeans to show off that great pair of genes you've been blessed with!",5,"Fits like an old glove!

B000YXC2LI,,"I'm sure I'm old school. For instance, I value my time. I imagine a lot of people do. Which is why they invented zippers. Zippers really are incredibly handy. Imagine you've got to catch a bus in just a few moments. Then nature calls. Well, it's a quick matter to take care of things and get out there to the bus.

But, the new graduates of (Fill in the Name of Your Favorite Prestigious Business School) have decided that they have a better idea. Don't they always? Replace the zipper with not three, not four, but five separate buttons to close the fly. This does not include the button where the belt comes together (which, assuming the Prestigious Business School taught them had to use both hands to add) comes to a total of six. Of course, you don't really need to undo the topmost button to take care of business. But, the whole arrangement of the buttons being fastened into an inner last just complicates things. It really is a pain in the fly.

And, really, why? The cute (I'll give them that) buttons aren't visible, so are meaningless. They aren't particularly easy to fasten (if easy at all). As William Shakespeare said when he tried these on: Much ado about nothing.

I agree with the reviews of many others. These are the last Levi's I buy. Stick with what works. There's a reason flies have zippers. Even if prestigious Business School Graduates think they don't.",1,A pain in the fly... Note to self: Always read the fine print (and other reviews).

The fabric is a little different than my other pairs,  not sure if that is because of the color I picked (and how they process the color) or if it's some cost savings measure so they can lower the price.

I work in them, and unfortunately, they don't last particularly long, longer than the el cheapo jeans you buy at the big box stores, but not as long as pants marketed specifically as work clothes. They are, however, super comfortable, so worth it in a way.",4,I've always liked these jeans

B000YXC2LI,,"I'm 70 years old and have been wearing Levi 501's since I was 9! Those good days are over! For  the first thirty years I bought the shrink to fit version which was a pain for the first 5 washings, bet then they were great for years. Then they offered the preshrunk version which was more user friendly. 501's used to last many years ... I always had several pair and they all fit the same. The current version is junk! Don't waste your money! They don't fit properly anymore and they are poorly made! The last two pair I bought were too big in the waste and butt and too tight in the thigh area. Actually, that was only for one pair, the other pair had distinctly different issues. I wish I could say I've slimmed down in the waste and bulked up my thighs but I'd be lying if I did! Like everyone else's reviews, the belt loops mysteriously unattach themselves and the rear pocket corners rip open. I can only assume that the 10 year old working in the sweatshop in Jakarta couldn't afford breakfast when he began his 12 hour day at the sewing machine! The large corporations like Levi will continue to sell products of poorer quality at higher prices as long as we are dumb enough to continue buying them!",1,Cheap offshore junk!

Now, the new pair that I received recently: the fabric feels thicker. Not as good as it was in 1980ies, but as good as it gets these days. There's new stitch around the fly (see the pic). The big disappointment is the fact they changed buttons' supplier. Buttons are lighter and thinner now (see the pic). I like the buttons on my old 501. That's why I wanted to give 3 stars, but the fabric is quite thick, feels thicker then the one I had with previous pair. Result - 4 stars. Leg length is as expected.

They never fit as well, looked as good on and certainly cost a lot more. Well as I have aged, I have gotten smarter . I went back to try 501's. It took several trys to get the right size. But I didn't give up. The Levi's 501 are the best fitting jeans ever made. I didn't get the original shrink to fit. I did get the preshrunk ready to go. The fit is just as great as they were when I wore them in my teens. The fit is flattering, soooo comfortable, and perfect. They don't look like old lady jeans or jeans that are about to fall off. The waist is where it should be for jeans. The cut of the leg is great and the leg is great for boots, heels, sandles, or tennis shoes.

On this pair the legs were tight and waist loose, causing them to expose my lower back when sitting. Not a fan of the button fly overall but have a few older pairs of 501's which fit perfectly. Stitching was poor and they were Made in Mexico which I believe are better than the other foreign countries Levi's makes their jeans in now.

B000YXC2LI,,"Ordered two pairs of Levi's 501 original fit from Amazon, less than one month apart. While the sizing seems consistent, the second pair, made in Egypt, is definitely made from lighter-weight denim than the first, which was made in Mexico. The weights are 678 g and 725 g, a difference of 47 g, or about 1.7 oz. If a pair takes about 1.5 yards of fabric to make (32w x 30l) this means that the Egyptian denim has a weight of about 1 oz per yard less than the Mexican. This is reflected in an immediately noticeable difference in ""feel"" -- the Egyptian pair has a softer hand; the Mexican pair seems sturdier and more canvas-like. A couple of stitching details also seem more careless on the Egyptian, although there are enough authentic features so that I don't suspect a counterfeit -- maybe it's just sloppy quality control? In any event I'm reluctant to order more, since there is no way to specify country of origin and it's not possible to be sure what I'm going to get. The Mexican pair is solid and great, taking off one star for lack of manufacturing consistency.",4,"Nice, solid jeans, but some inconsistency depending on country where manufactured."

B000YXC2LI,,"I really like the way these fit.  I have a bit of a belly but a skinny butt.  Typical 60+ year old guy.  These fit me perfectly.  I went to the Levi's store to look for jeans that fit (and weren't ""dad"" jeans) and the young ladies said to try these.  I used to wear 501's when I was younger and was leary.  However they said these ""original fit"" (not original shrink to fit) don't shrink much and should work out.  They were right, these non-shrink to fit 501s are very comfortable.  I wash them cold, usually hang dry (although I have dried them a couple times, so I know that they don't shrink much).  I also use the Woolite Dark detergent which helps to keep the dark blue darker (which for this pair is what I wanted). Definitely not ""dad"" jeans.  The button fly is a bit of a pain, but you get used to it (just as I did back in the ""old"" days). I have both the dark blue and a khaki colored pairs.  Note these are definitely not work jeans they are a lighter denim (although the khaki seem a bit heavier) and to me are more of a casual wear/fashion jean.  I think that is why a lot of people post negative reviews about them.  Not every pair of jeans is designed for hard work environments.  When I am doing that, I wear my Carhartt canvas work pants.

B000YXC2LI,24.0,"Have been wearing Levi's for years. They fit as usual. I enjoyed them because I always knew what size to order, and I thought I enjoyed the fit. However, recently Levi's have been poorly made. The material is thin and doesn't hold up. I also have found that the crotch area tends to pinch my tender spots when I sit down. After spending $50 for a pair or jeans and having them get torn in the crotch area after a week or working, I have since changed to Wrangler. I have found the 47 fit to be similar to Levi's, yet much stronger, and i don't experience the crotch pinch and tear like I do with my old 501's. I will say that I keep one new pair of 501's in the closet for my going out jeans. The color of 501's is hard to match in other brands, so  when I need a more fancy pair to wear out, I still go to my one pair of 501's. If you work in your jeans, I would recommend trying a pair of Wrangler 47's for a more durable and half the cost pair of jeans.",2,Levi's have lost me as a customer

B000YXC2LI,,"Started buying 501's in 2011 when I started college, but I wore strictly Levi's growing up. I still have three old pairs of 501's from that time. Two prewashed and one pair of shrink to fits. The fit on all of them is similar, but the ones I worked outdoors in and washed and dried more had a slimer fit in the legs. I spent a year & a half in the shrink to fits but overall: they are alittle less comfortable and less flattering. Of all of them, the last pair I purchased, ablack pre washed with dark gray rivets and regular patch, a combination they no longer make I think, are the only ones I still use, now that I can fit into them again. For a while I switched to Wrangler 13wmz's after I gained some weight. I wanted to buy some new 501s since I've been getting alota use out of those old ones. I went to a local Levi's retailer to try some on to determine just was size I should buy online. I'm glad I did because I found that 501s are not what they used to be. Now, I've heard from my dad, my old boss, and other loyal Levi's customers that Levi's used to be made with a more stiff, durable denim fabric, and from the vintage Levi's I've collected and seen, I can say that's the truth. But as long as I have buying them new for myself, they've been kinda lightweight (Good for the weather here in Texas), with a distinct smoothness after significant wear, and still pretty durable. Today, the fabric feels completely different, although I can't speak to its durability. My biggest complaint is with the fit. Pictures of the aforementioned folks during the 70's & 80's show a jean that looks similar to the jeans I used buy. I can't really say that's still true. These new 501's don't have the roomy seat that I associate with the cut, they sit lower on the waist, and the pewter riveted buttons on the fly and waist are smaller and more delicate than they used to be. The crotch it's more comfortable now, sure, but I liked the snug, old school, cowboy look that they used to have. They basically fit like a slightly relaxes skinny jean now, and personally, I think skinny jeans look absurd with western boots, on both men and women, and that's usually what I wear. I have always loved Levi's, and think that the old 501 cut will always have a nostalgia and elegance in design that other jeans just don't have, but they have lost my business with these recent changes.",2,they are alittle less comfortable and less flattering
B000YXC2LI,,"thought I was getting the original heavy fabric, it is thin.",3,Three Stars
B000YXC2LI,3.0,"I've worn 501s most of my life.  I just love the button fly.  Plus they give me a butt where other brands don't.  But Levi's are getting so much harder to find anymore.  Around here, Wranglers reign supreme.  I'd lost enough weight that the size 32s had beco,e rather baggy for me to wear.  I saw these on Amazon and the price was great.  They normally sell for $79 at Penny's or Macy's.  Plus, the size that I need are even more difficult to find.  I guess it's the proof you'd need to see that America has gotten fatter.  The 32"" inseam is just too short.  Even the 34"" inseam is kinda short than I like.  So how difficult is it to find size 29"" waist with 36"" inseam?  Very difficult it turns out.  Apparently Levi doesn't make a 29""/36"" jean anymore.

So I ordered a size 29"" waist with 34"" inseam.  They fit great, though the length I fear is gonna come up a tad short.  Fearing this, I also ordered a size 30"" waist with 36"" inseam.  They are a tad baggy.  The length was perfect though.  So frustrating.  I'm gonna keep them just in case I do gain a bit of weight though.  I'll just have to be happy with the 34"" inseam for the 29"" waist.

On the jeans themselves.  It seems the denim they are using is a bit thinner than what they used to use.  My old 32""s that I've had for well over 10 years and been wearing them day in and day out, putting them thru hell and back, have worn down and becoming thread bare, yet it still seems to be a thicker denim.  I just hope these Levi 501s will stand up to the abuse that I'm used to for a pair of denim jeans.",5,Love 501s

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Well, I have really tried to give Levi 501 a fair shake due to my loyalty to the company. They have always been my favorite jeans that fit the best and hold up over time. Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!! I will be donating to Good Will because I refuse to wear and advertise or promote your product. If I were Amazon I would refuse to sell this product as advertised.

I expected exactly the same jeans in this most recent order, but got something that is tighter, shorter, in lighter fabric, and with a ""striated"" appearance in the fabric.  They seem like cheap, counterfeit knock-offs of the original.  How does that happen when you hit the ""order these again"" button on your Amazon account?

These were actually quite tight when I ordered them and had a much longer breaking in period than usual.  I suppose I might be gaining weight, but older pairs (again, in the exact same size) fit beautifully and I will occasionally wash them to shrink them back to size.  This pair is finally broken in enough to be more or less comfortable, though still a touch snug.  I will probably size up next time, though, and explore other fits.  I really like the color, quality, and the button fly, but these are practically full-on skinny jeans now, whereas they used to be a bit looser without being baggy.",4,"Am I going crazy, or do these keep getting skinnier every year?"

I'm also a repeat buyer of the tan ""Timberwolf"" color -- t goes really well with many different shirt colors, just as khakis do..  I do agree with those other reviewers who say that Levi's seems to be using thinner fabrics (probably to save money and, perhaps, to make them more appealing in market areas with warmer climates south of the border where 501's remain somewhat popular).  Even so, the lighter fabric does not wear out particularly fast in my experience.

Material color was a white and navy dotted mix, the rivets are silver colored rather than original copper, but worst of all are the deep fake wrinkles that are molded into the crotch and thigh area.  That may be OK for the younger crowd, but for us old timers who grew up with the stiff, selvage denim 501s of the '60s it just isn't going to do.

They were shrink to fit so you had to buy them 2 sizes bigger than what would normally fit you and they were stiff and dark blue. There weren't any pre-washed or pre-shrunk jeans then. Now with the 501's you have the best of all worlds if you ask me. They are pre-shrunk and you can choose how dark or light you want them.

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"You will not find American made Levis on Amazon! If you want genuine selvedged Levis, you have to go to the official Levi website.  They run around $60+

I ordered two pair of 38x34 from amazon. One made in Egypt, and one made in Mexico.  The legs on one pair were 2 inches longer than the other pair, and the material is thin compared to the jeans I expect from Levis.  The stitching is also single hem down the inseam, and the belt loops are chincy! I feel like I could tear them apart with my bare hands!

They will probably last a little while, but if you spend a little more on AMERICAN made products, your overall satisfaction will more than make up for the higher price paid.

On 10/20/16 the Levi website is running a deal where you get 20% off two items, or 30% off three items (jeans).  Look at the materials list for your particular jeans to make sure they were made in America, but if you spend less than $60, you can be sure they were produced in another country.

Hope this helps, because if you like genuine Levis, this is how you should get em!",1,Get real Levi's...

I have a pair of Levi's 505 straight-leg jeans, and I would recommend the 501s over those. While they are similar in look, I find the 505s to be very constricting in the thigh and crotch area; it took me a wash before those fit tolerably well, whereas the 501s fit amazingly right from the starta perfect mix of snugness and openness.

This is my first pair of 501s and I bought them mainly to wear with cowboy boots and they look amazing; buy them in a dark wash (I recommend Clean Rigid, the darkest blue wash available and the color I bought them in) and pair them with some black or dark brown cowboy boots and a slick dress shirt, and you've got an effortless, put-together look with a country charm.

I love these jeans and will likely buy another, shorter pair soon to wear with dress shoes. I'll update this review if I have anything to add then.

B000YXC2LI,,"I had many, many jeans. The 501 is probably the most comfortable jeans for daily use. Heavy material, good fit, and evenly distributed weight over my hip. All other jeans I had (including other Levi's) gave me bad pressure on certain area of my hip as the hip area is either too small or too big. I am 5""10, 145lb with skinny altheletic build, and the cut is just perfect. Compare to my 511 or 517, this is far more superior in everyway.

However, the manufacture consistency is very poor. I ordered two pairs of jeans. While both labeled the same size, one is an inch wider then the other. I highly recommend buying 2-3 pairs and return the ones that don't fit. In most cases, all of them will feel different. Shame on Levi's with no quality control, one star off for that.

Conclusion is, 501 is really well made as long as the fit is good. If you do not like button fly, go with 505 instead, which is exactly the same jeans with zipper fly. I cannot say for people with super skinny or chubby body, but for average shape people, 501 will fit well and comfortable through out the day.",4,"Good fit, good material, bad manufacture"

I mean what happened to Jeans that rip at the knees!? -  So I dialed up a pair of the ol classics - 501 button flys.  I haven't warn a pair of these since College, but boy did I love'em back then.  This particular pair is perfect - the fabric is lightweight and the fit was spot on - even through the ol Daddy bulge.  A word of caution though - I ordered what I thought to be an identical pair in a lighter color and the fit on those was NOT the same.  The Jean material was MUCH thicker and the fit clunky.  I wish Amazon would include fabric weighting to the descriptions of the different colors...",5,"I had lost my way, but now I am found: 501 button fly BABY!"

Decided to drop by a Kohls to grab a pair considering they have OKish deals on clothes most of the time.  Their sale price on Levi's was astronomical!

Two more pairs of 501s from Macy's, same thing. Levi's really has to step their game up, or they are going to lose the American market. The sad thing is that the same Chinese and Egyptian-made 501s are going for the equivalent of about US$100 in department stores in Taiwan.

So, what gives?

It's the rise!!!  These are a higher rise than most jeans.  I measured the rise on the 541 as 11"".  The rise on the 501 was 14.5""!  So, when I wear these jeans at my waist like usual, the extra rise pushes everything down and now the jeans are way too long because the crotch is hanging lower.  I can't wear them any higher or else I'll look like my Grandpa.  I washed in super hot water and dried on high and that shrunk them in a half an inch at most.

So if your looking for ready to wear Levi's 501 Original jeans. This is what you need!!!  If you want the pain of washing and drying to fit. Get the ones that say SHRINK TO FIT. The package arrived on time. Nicely packaged. I examined them with a fine tooth comb. All seams were professionally sewn. No little threads hanging out. The denim seemed like I remember my old ones. I figure I'll wear these awhile. Then was in cold water. Dry on low or permanent press setting. Of course they'll fade with time. Also be alot more comfortable. Who cares where they're made. Mine are from Mexico. But the quality control of Levi Strauss seems to be working. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend these!!

The fit has changed with way too much room in the seat, the Old Style Double seam down the inseam is not a skimpy little one seam, and the bottom hem is about 1/3 the size it was being only about 3/16 of an inch causing the pants to roll up.

I don't know, I keep looking for New Old Stock or even well cared for 501's everywhere now because I'll NEVER WEAR the new cheap version that Levis is trying to push on the public.

Boy, after putting them on, I recalled why I stopped buying Levis several years before. They feel cheap. My Wranglers are much stronger (I wear them while horseback riding), and I never feel as if they are about to split. These 501s were nearly twice what I pay for other jeans, and feel fragile, as if they'll split. Their weight is far too light, and nothing like the Levis I once wore. I will never buy a pair again. I would have returned these except that I really wanted to wear my new shoes last night, and these were the only jeans short enough.",1,What a shame.

So OK - there are ""two way"" to shrink to fit OR just start wearing them. Well they wouldn't work just wearing them so I washed em in hot water and dried em. STILL too big. So I washed em a couple more times in hot water. They fit OK except for ONE THING! They are SO high waisted! And just looked funny (like the old man with his pants pulled up over the belly!) - so anyway - I will return them and find something else. The fabric is as close to the originals as you will find I believe and when washed they looked great. BUT didn't fit!",2,Still Trying to find the PERFECT 501s!

The seat and legs were noticeably baggier than the first pair. I like my jeans somewhat tight, and the second pair was nothing like the first pair except for the color.

The pant arrived on time and fit as expected. The fabric is what you expect from Levi's jeans.

However the quality of the pant is not what you would expect from Levi's. My main complaints are:

1. one of the buttons is stained. (see pic)
2. the stitches were defective and imprecise (see pictures) on the leg and on the fly. The stitches bleed out all across the leg and the machine seemed to have pulled the fabric creating ""bumps"".

For a prestigious brand like Levi's this is not acceptable and I would not recommend buying these pants even though they are priced very well.",1,Beware of Egypt made Levis' jeans because they have low quality standards.

That was about 20 years ago, and I've struggled ever since to find a fit like those 550s of the early 90s.

But when I put on a pair of these modern 501s, they fit like I expect jeans to fit, which is to say close but not snug, with no bagging/sagging around the butt. A good, classic fit. (I'm 6' tall and of average build and just under the line of what would be considered overweight.)

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"I returned them as they were cut weird.
I have worn these jeans for over 30 years and have noticed since they are made in several different places on earth and being cut in large amounts, the sizes are way off. It has nothing to do with the seller. It has to do with where they are made.
If any of you wonder why when you buy the same size jeans and they don't fit like your other ones, this is why.
It took doing some research to find out why my jeans quit fitting right when buying the same size.
There is an inside label that will tell you where they were made. This explains part of the problem of why they don't fit right, or why you can try on several pairs of the same labeled size and they all fit different.
I have learned it is well worth the effort to try on several pair of the same size to find the one that works for you.
This particular pair was uncomfortably tight in the thighs, which has never been an issue before with these jeans.",2,Didn't fit right

Quality of the cloth is fine as is construction, but the sizing is slightly off and the belt loops seem to be misplaced.  Waist too big, length too short.  With so many Levi options available online, it's best to shop in a store where you can actually try on what you're considering purchasing so that you know it fits.  At least that way you don't get surprised.  Let's hope when I wash them they don't turn into a whole new product line ... Levi Capri 501s.",2,Quality of the cloth is fine as is construction

However, I'm finding that weather it comes from the store or amazon, if you get colors other than one of the ""stonewash"" colors, the fit is very different.

One of the 505 was arguably ""light stonewash"" but the 501 was much darker.  Its like, well we don't really have a light wash, but probably they won't return on that alone, so just send what we have.

Also, the 505, as I read the specs, should be cut identically to the 501 but for that order the 505 fit much closer to the ""big boy"" 550 cut.  Now what?",4,I wish they would send the right wash.

B000YXC2LI,,"It has been a while since I've purchased Levi's 501 jeans.  I remembered them as high quality, no nonsense...good looking jeans.  Wow, how things have changed for the worse!  The waist line is lower, I keep having to pull my pants up and I'm pretty average sized person.  Also the hem at the bottom of the legs is smaller, thus they have a tendency to roll up when washed, it looks strange and it's hard to get them to lie straight like they are suppose to.  These plus a few other things all seem like ways Levi is trying to cut cost...I'll bet on it.  Overall I'm disappointed and will not buy Levi's jeans again.",2,What happened to an old favorite?

B000YXC2LI,20.0,Disappointing. I bought a few and all fit well when I tried them on. The problem I had with the jeans came up as I washed them before I used them. I have some kind of OCD thing when it comes to folding my jeans. I have to line up the bottom hems up first before I fold them. I noticed that Levi decided to shorten the bottom hem so no matter what I do they curl upwards. They went from appoxamatly 1/4 inch to less then 1/8 of an inch. The other thing I dislike is the number of tags they added to inside of the jeans. I'm a big guy and wear my jeans around the gut not under. The tags some how work them selfs up and out the top. That's not a biggy and is easily handled with some sissors. I noticed that stitching has gone down in quality from my older jeans. I put a 5 or so year old jeans on top of the new ones and saw the one ones just don't feel as durable as the old ones. I loved Levi's until I got these. The price has gone up while the quality has gone down. I think I will be switching over to wranglers because they cheaper and fit better. I have a few wranglers and they are double stitched in places where Levi's are only single stitched.,2,Time to switch to a different brand

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Despite being advertised as 14oz fabric they weigh less on a precision scale and are measurably thinner (almost 10%) via caliper compared to 501s from 2009 - which obviously have been worn and washed. The new fabric is softer and flimsier to handle. Fly button holes are no longer zig-zag stitched properly. Seams and workmanship overall are inferior. (Both pairs being compared are from Mexico)

These are a bit better than the 9oz denim Levi 505s have gone to. I may be old fashioned but the jeans should feel more substantial than the t-shirt one is wearing. Thus two stars instead of one...",2,A mere shadow of what 501's once were.

B000YXC2LI,,I bought a pair of these jeans from this seller a few weeks ago and am extremely happy. First off they are the only ones that offer some of the more rare finishes for this particular jean. For example the iconic rigid and new metal colors are extremely hard to find and they look extremely great. I picked a pair of both of these colors and got them for a great deal. And fast shipping too! These jeans are a must have for any classic levis 501 fan.,5,Classic Levis 501 Jeans
B000YXC2LI,,"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

It finally occurred to me to try the obvious, and check out the men's department instead. I'm overjoyed to discover that men's standard Lev... Read more",5,The quintessence of pants

B000YXC2LI,,"I have been wearing Levis 501s for as long as I remember. Also, i have been wearing the same size 30x30 since i was 19; I am now 40 :-( The other reviews are correct in that it seems the material is thinner. The jeans fray quicker with washes. However, I am a believer that jeans are not meant to be washed regularly. If I am not mistaken, even Levi Strauss recommends that their jeans are not to be washed often as it breaks down the fabric (from personal experiance; this is true). Actually, the thinner material makes them even more comfortable.
IMHO, forget all the brand names, fads and wierd fashions, 501s fit the same, look the same and are simply the best. Period.",5,Havent Let Me Down Yet

Levis was my go-to for jeans. Sadly, no more. I don't know what has happened to their quality, but someone along the line in whoever is managing their manufacturing has really dropped the ball. I got four pairs of jeans, two stonewashed, and two black, and every pair ripped in the crotch within two months. I am accustomed to a certain amount of wear over time in the inseam, but this is completely unacceptable.

I'm not the kind of guy who goes around doing Chuck Norris moves on random passers by in the street. I walk normally, act normally, and move pretty much like the average American in a typical casual office setting would move when walking from one place to the next. I do not think that my expectations are particularly high to think that I can enjoy this style of motion in my life without worrying about my jeans splitting so rapidly.

if these were what he was looking for and gave them to him for his 60th Birthday. I could tell he really was surprised! ""Where in the world

B000YXC2LI,,"How strange they can't move production off-shore and get it right! There have been conscious changes in design that detract from the classic 501 look.

Throughout the run I viewed, dozens at a local JC Penny, the thread was the wrong color; yellow not gold. I have looked at these for years and see the same sort of ""mistakes"".
The rear pockets have been given s strange flared look, not like in the photos here.
They can't even get the ""W"" on the rear pocket right! At least a little better than I have seen in the past that looked sewn by drunks!

The fit was ok and the color of the denim pretty good BUT if like me you have worn these jeans since th 60's it's easy to spot the weird differences and while if you landed from another planet and had no idea you may find them just great but not me.

I went with some Lee's. To long time Lee wearers there may be the same complaints but the Lee's are $42 and Levis $68 where I looked! ($26 vs $46 on Amazon). Wranglers also looked nicer but don't fit me right and were mid way in price.

Those I saw were made in Columbia and I was sure I had a pair of USA 501's on and checked and they are also made in Columbia! MIne are exact replica's of the 70's 501's I'm used to. Got them at a thrift store 3 years ago and have no idea of their vintage but a superior pants.

B000YXC2LI,3.0,Levis....what has happened?? In just a few months these Jeans are ripped out in the crotch.  Usually it takes years for Levis to fall apart.  I would also like to mention = what is with sewing the pocket so your index finger gets stuck in the seem on the way down???  The first thing I do is cut the 1/2 inch of thread off the pocket where you decided to sew up the side of the  pocket instead of stopping at the corner.  This way my finger doesn't get stuck in the pocket on the way down.  Quality has really dropped and I've been a lifelong 501 Levis buyer and the last 3 or 4 years of Levis are just getting worse and worse.,1,From the Mind of Bob

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"No Longer the jeans of a generation or two. I am 63yrs. old and probably have 20 pair of Levi 501's. The jeans of the baby boomers and then some. But all good things, they have come to the end. DO NOT BY THESE JEANS ON LINE!!!! Their are about five types of denim now being used, and the quality ranges from ""just like it was in the eighties to, what the hell are these things"". The only thing consistent about the 501's (and the 514's) is that the inconsistency in both fit, size, and especially quality is astounding. I called Levi's myself, and they are aware of the inconsistentency in their products. They have opened up new factories so quickly, that the problem went unnoticed for almost 2 years. They were very honest with me, and are working diligently to alleviate the problem. Eighteen pair of mine are perfect in every way. All are consistent in every way. The last two pair I purchased were off to each other in every way. The waist and inseam are off as much as 3/4 of an inch. When I put my wallet in the back pocket on one new pair, The back pocket ripped @ the corner. That when I called them, and they admitted that the weight of the denim was one of the problems. They gave me a credit for a new pair. However, the difference between old and new was to great. Again, go to an Army store if you can, but do not buy on line. Let the buyer beware!!!",1,"But all good things, they have come to the end"

It seems to order something listed as ""rigid"" will be a more denim traditional style material but in trying this one listed as ""original fit"" as opposed to the other one..it arrived a lesser denim material and some parts of it wrinkled like around calve area of leg. Like possibly when it was made it had some type of drying machine that left wrinkles only on parts of the jeans.
Not going to return these but clearly with this material and the more snugger fit than I wanted these will become dry clean only to avoid any further disaster..slowly beginning to believe I must buy Levi's locally to ensure the quality and texture I'm getting first and foremost.

The white pair I ordered had the plastic wrap torn off the rear pockets and have light dirt stains. It makes me wonder if they are knock offs because the overall impression of them is sketchy at best. In both pairs there are tags that say ""made in Egypt"" and then information on the other side written in Chinese. I have always trusted Amazon to deal with approved vendors who meet certain standards. This time I'm skeptical if I genuinely received what I expected. I would not reorder from this vendor.",1,Could These be Knockoffs ?

After researching on line, I discovered that Levi's changed the cuts of their basic line and now has a wide variety of fits, which probably accounts for the 501's being cut a little leaner in the leg and crotch. I'll take it as my bad for not being a better informed shopper. At least one thing about Levi's that hopefully will never change: I can trade these for ones that fit just about anywhere that sells them, no questions asked.",4,There're more than just 501's

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I wore 501 shrink to fit for 40+ years and always loved them. The last batch wore out so I bought these. The material is very weak compared to what it used to be. Worse, they must be cut differently because they slid down when I didn't have a belt on. Worse than that, when I put a belt on, there were not enough belt loops (only 5) so on each side in the back, the belt rode up over the pants until the belt was in direct contact with my skin. I was walking all over the territory constantly reaching back to pull my pants up in public to get the pants back under the belt. ENOUGH!
I was going to take them down to the local thrift store to donate but then thought why plague someone else with this problem? I threw them in the trash where they belong. Now I buy other jeans that fit fine and have 7 belt loops. What a relief! Bye bye Levi, I'm sad things didn't work out.",1,"Goodbye Levi, I threw the jeans in the trash"

Maybe they will shrink right but that is only part of the problem.  The description said ""Rigid.""  That they aren't.  The last pair I bought in Texas was indeed rigid.  This pair is inferior denim, as light weight as the cheaper jeans made in China.  These were made in Egypt and it shows.  The big disappointment though was that they came pre-wrinkled at the top.  I have seen this style on the Levis website and would had definitely avoided it, had I known.  The photo show does not show wrinkles up close.

B000YXC2LI,,"Still breaking these in, but I'll probably get another pair.  Good jeans, historically.  I like the fit.  They're not the body-conscious, skinny-jeans type fit that you see almost everywhere today, but they're not baggy either.  I would say if you're looking to fit your booty but not ostentatiously, this may be the way to go.  Maybe size down one in the waist if you want a more body-conscious butt fit (some of us are more posterior-impaired than others).  I wear a 31/32 in khakis, but not worn around the waist, and that's a slim-fit, great on the rear.  For jeans I wanted something a little more comfortable.  I think these will shrink a bit to fit.

Update:  I have bought four pairs of these jeans now.  Except for one of them, the colors were all true to the website image.  One, ""cascade wonderland,"" looks like a flat cobalt or lapis blue on the website.  What was sent to me looked like black jeans that had aged badly, just ugly in a thrifting kind of way (and I usually like thrift store things, but sometimes...).  Sent them back.  The replacement, in lodestone, is great.  It's kind of khaki-colored, but really more of a gold.  Great fall color.",4,You can still stand by the old standby

After half a day on the first wear they were in worse shape than Levi's he has worn for over three years. The inseams wore; the seams began to separate; and there were holes in the crotch on both legs. Completely unacceptable when you can't wear a new pair of pants for an entire day without having to throw them out. Needless to say I am returning them.

B000YXC2LI,,"I grew up a loyal 501's customer into my early 20's. After a 20 year hiatus, I decided I would treat myself to a new pair of my favorite jeans, determined to never wear a different pair of jeans again. For me...501's or bust! Unfortunately, some changes have taken place over the years that I was unaware of. It appears that these jeans have a much different cut than they did in the past. While they fit at the waist and the length is perfect, they are tight throughout...and I'm skinny! First question my wife had for me was ""What's the difference between those jeans and skinny jeans?"" I don't know! Furthermore, the new cut presents a defect in the rear, at least on the pair that I bought from Sears. Some weird new cut pouch has been created just above the back pockets. So now, when I'm wearing jeans that I'm supposed to be proud of, people can wonder to themselves ""Why does that guy have a back pocket pouch?"" I bought the jeans at Sears where I am disallowed to return them unless there's a defect. I don't know if they'll accept ""back pocket pouch"" as a defect and my suspicion is that an exchange will only provide me with an additional pair of ""back pocket pouch"" jeans. After 20 years of anticipation, it's unfortunate that my return to Levi's 501's was so disappointing. I won't refrain from recommending these to others, but try them on before purchasing. They are not your fathers Levis. As for me, I've transitioned to the Wrangler rigid cowboy cut jeans and while they are not Levi's, I like the cut (I can wear them with boots or sneakers) and the heavy denim of the jeans.

PS- I did write Levis concerning the new cut. I have included the response I received: We occasionally update our products based on consumer feedback and demand. Im sorry the recent update hasn't worked for you. Ill share your thoughts with our product managers, as they pay close attention to consumer feedback.",2,Not the Same As It Ever Was

These pants are not worthy of the Levi's label, or perhaps it is, because now to me Levi's stands for ""gamble"", ""not trustworthy""...The material cannot even be called ""Denim"" anymore.  Like other jeans on the market, the twill is a lightweight flannel-like material that are apparently designed to disintegrate more quickly such that you are forced to buy (subscribe to) more jeans.  It's a wasteful process and such a shame. I was hoping I could dodge all the low quality crap and go with a tried and true brand such as Levi's, but they seem to be no different from the rest.  There is no reason why a made in U.S. jean by an American brand should cost $200 a pair.  If you find a reasonably priced pair of Levi's, like these, it's because they are made in Mexico or China of inferior ingredients and craftsmanship.  I'm truly heartbroken.

Since I recently slimmed down, I was excited to feel that sexy lean look in my slim pair of Levi's (been wearing Wranglers for the last 15 years because I'd gained weight).  Well, what she did not tell me was that they had a button front --- definitely NOT what I wore in high school and college!  And my stubby hands could not even button more than one button.  It was just too hard!  She was also wrong about the 505's being more roomy.  The fit of the 501's was the same as the 505's.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I bought two pairs of the 501 Levi's for $30 each about 7 years ago. These pairs lasted for about 6 years with regular use and key to this story, they both wore out in the thighs (not the crotch) - where I expect bluejeans to wear out. I loved them. A year ago it was finally time to replace my old jeans. I bought another two pairs of the 501 Levi's, which had gone up $20 per pair, but no problem: I loved the other pairs so much that I was willing to spend $50 on each new pair of jeans.

Fast forward four months. A hole appeared in the crotch of Pair #1. Bummer, but on to Pair #2...

...8 months later, a hole in the same place on Pair #2 - I haven't been walking any differently than before, I have not been doing splits, and I haven't started getting lap dances or anything. Okay, time to talk to the company.

So I read up on the Levi lifetime warranty for defects in material and workmanship. Surely this batch of Levi's were defective. I took both pairs to a Levi Outlet Store. The sales clerk inspected the pants. He thought for a little while. And he reached a judgement: the holes were from normal use. I explained that I was living my life in the same way as before, but he already has his conclusion. After I expressed my disappointment in the quality of these pants and that Levi was not going to honor their warranty, the sales associate, as a last resort to get me out of his store, offered me a discount on a new pair. I decided that no, in fact I would not pay any more money for jeans that have a lifespan of months. Also, I will not buy any more jeans from Levi because I feel that they have been insincere in their warranty and to their customers, and they are making second-rate jeans.",1,"Higher Price, Lower Quality"

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Day 2 of wearing these, the top rivet breaks off. We have a neighbor who is very crafty and likes to sew, asked if she could repair, she says sure - and so I get them back, almost good as new. (which as it turns out, isn't saying a whole lot) The ""new"" rivet is slightly different shade of metal - big whoop. So I wear them for a few more days, and go t put them in the wash when I notice the very back belt loop has torn off from the bottom.

Look on the label, made in Indonesia.

These jeans are pure, unadulterated CRAP. The Levi's name used to mean something.

Lesson learned for me. One more brand to add to the ""Do not buy"" list.",1,Simple truth - these are trash. Levis should be ashamed to put their name on these.

Worse, the buttonholes are so small I practically couldn't get them buttoned. I regretted the effort immediately as getting them unbuttoned was even more difficult.

It is a slightly different material than typical blue version - a little thinner, as specified. But the length ended up more like what I expect from a 32"" inseam. Anyway, that's not too short for me and they fit great otherwise. I will try 33/36 if buying black again.",4,Darn shrinkage!
B000YXC2LI,,"Ultimately, I returned these because they were too tight on my upper thighs.  I was really sad to do it, though, because they looked great.  I was just worried that the pressure of my apparently huge thighs would cause these to rip.

My order arrived when promised, and was carefully boxed and packaged in individually sealed plastic packets.  When I opened the packets and tried them on it was like returning home for the first time after a 35 year absence!  Just like I remembered, they fit snug to your body at first, but then conformed to your individual curves with a couple of hours of wear.  I'm a guy who has been wearing zip fly jeans for the last 35 years, so the button fly takes a little getting used to again, but the feeling of wearing the jeans I grew up in is un-paralleled!

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Twenty years ago, you could sell these jeans for several hundreds of dollars per pair abroad. They are the button fly, the classic Levi's jeans before zippers were invented. If you are a man, getting a sensitive area caught in the zipper is excruciating. This only happened once to me, and I switched to button fly. They are a classic fit, very favorable to your physique, durable and comfortable. They only come in about four or five colors to my knowledge, but this is a small price to pay for what will undoubtedly become your favorite pair of jeans for everywhere. Today, it seems that everyone the world over prefers to wear jeans. Even corporate positions have relaxed their dress codes, and casual and comfortable has become the norm. You can wear them with a sport coat to dress it up a bit. I always prefer to honor the inventor or originator of any product, and Levi was absolutely the first to make a pair of jeans, as I recall in the late 1800's or early 1900's in San Francisco for the gold miners. Since then, so many people have tried to copy them, but, in my opinion, Levi's are still the best. There are more durable jeans, the ones made from canvas or firehose sheathing fabric, and I have to admit I own several pair of these for work. But for just knocking around in, Levi's are the most comfortable. If you've never owned a pair of button fly Levi's, I strongly recommend you try a pair...you'll be hooked.",5,Levi's 501 jeans are a Classic.

Just for fun, I bought a pair of store brand jeans at walmart.  I compared the quality side by side.

Because the 501's I bought (something I've been buying for decades) fell apart in 6 months.  the seams, literally, came apart at the seams.  I've owned 501's that lasted for 20 years.

B000YXC2LI,,"Ok I love Levis. I've played around with the 514s and even the slimmer 513s. 514s are ok, but the jean material is super thin. A good jean for the summer I guess.  The 513's have stretch fabric in then making them feel like yoga pants but they look ok.

I tried the 501s and I love them! They fit like 514s but with WAY better denim fabric and they sit on your seat way better. 514s sit below the waist which apparently sucks when comparing it to sitting above the waist. For record I got the rinse wash color. It's a quality thick denim. THEY ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL 501s. EVERYONE CHILL OUT. if you want those, buy the shrink-to-fit line (STF). The tag on the back right pocket will say shrink to fit (if you are buying in a store, otherwise amazon will say it in the headline).

I usually wear 33x34 I bought 33x34. They will stretch a bit to the normal size since it's quality denim.",5,FINALLY found the right jean

With the popularity of Skinny Jeans I wanted to be up-to-date. But I walk dogs and train them for a living.  I have very well developed legs.  Skinny Jeans are too tight around my calves and lower thighs. With genuine Levi's 501 ""shrink to fit"" jeans all I had to do is put them on, turn the hose on them and lay out in the sun on my chase lounge. It's an instant alteration!

Like most of you have stated, I have worn them all my life, and now have about 4-5 pairs sitting in the top of my closet because they don't match the size on the label. Not even by a long shot. I would say some of them have to be 2"" off in waist size, and one pair is off by at least 4"" in length (too long). Sad that my jean company was hijacked by the bean counters, but glad to find out it isn't just me.

I've moved on Levi's. It will take a return to quality and consistency to get me back. Good luck.",1,I thought it was just me!
B000YXC2LI,,"I have a pair of 501s that was wearing out on the front of the thighs, so I ordered a replacement pair of 501s of the same wash and size (36Wx34L). The old pair was made in Mexico, but the new pair was made in China. The new pair felt tight on the first wear, but I thought that was just part of breaking in a new pair of denim jeans. However, after a few months of wearing and washing them, I decided to compare them to my old pair. The Chinese jeans were a little over 1 inch shorter in the inseam as measured from the crotch seam. Also, the Chinese jeans were 1 inch smaller in the waist compared to the Mexico-made jeans.

So, my 34Wx36L jeans from China are equivalent to 33Wx35L jeans from Mexico.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Levi 501 button-fly jeans are THE classic jeans. They're not too baggy, nor too skinny. Levi uses great denim, and the construction is good quality. These are clearly ""firsts"" as there are no defects. The dark stonewash is the right amount of broken-in without being already worn-out.
Amazon carries a full range of sizes, including the 34 waist with 38 inseam my husband wears, so they have been our go-to for his Levis since 2010. The price is usually $10 or $20 below retail, sometimes even more.
One complaint, though, is the number of tags. It seems like a horrible waste of paper and ink, especially when one considers the quantity of 501s sold in a year.

In a year of wearing once or twice a week (including time at work in a meat processing plant) they are still going strong and are showing no signs of wearing out.

The only thing that was surprising is that instead of a zipper in the front these jeans had five or so metal buttons to fasten. It was offsetting at first, but you get used to it after a while. I still would prefer a zipper though.",5,great pair of pants

B000YXC2LI,,"I bought my first pair of 501's almost 30 years ago and immediately fell in love with them.  I liked the fit and they lasted forever.  Since then 501's is all I would wear.  I can't even think of how many pairs of jeans I have bought during that time.  However, in the past couple years I have become very disappointed with them.  I use to be able to walk into the store, grab my size off the shelf and pay for them.  I would have sales people ask if I wanted to try them on and I would say ""no thanks, I know they fit"".  Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.  Sorry Levi's but you lost this loyal customer by making inferior product and charging too much for it!",1,Goodbye Levi's Hello Wrangler

I've ordered the 'dark stone washed' a few years back and the quality of material was noticeably heavier, more like the classic 501 weight many reviewers refer to. The newer colors have varying weights and quality in my experience.  As a 5'6"" athletic guy, 30x30 fits me well but seem a tad slim through the thigh and cuff. Overall a decent pair if casual jeans.

If you ignore the fact that they are supposed to be Levi's, and how much you are paying for them, then they're okay. They're comfortable, and they fit as expected. They serve their function as pants, and they are certainly better than just painting your legs blue, albeit not by much.",2,Lower your expectations
B000YXC2LI,,"I've been wearing Levis jeans since I was a teen 50 years ago and, while I still like the way they look and fit, it's true what others have said:  they last about half as long as they used to due to, I assume, thinner material of possibly lesser quality.  They always wear through in the same place, too, just above the left knee, followed shortly by the right.  Believe it or not, just last week I had 3 pair of 501s, light stone wash color, all rip through within a week of each other.  In the 60s-70s I suspect those same jeans, if available, would have lasted me at least a couple more years.

i can accept and understand how they  made it lighter/thinner this time....but what's disturbing with the Levi's i got are the craftsmanship....how the stitches were. 2 major horrible things I sadly noticed...1.) the stiches along side the pants( the entire length of the thigh area ...which is the outer side of the pants...the stitches were horribly loose.i have to take it to a tailor the next day to have it reinforced. my girlfriend keep telling me maybe It was a fake...but i am convinced with amazon's items.i mean if it's sold by them.i trusted Amazon. i still feel they're not knockoffs even though they scream of being one. 2.) i don't know the technical name...or what to call it. the bottom edge of the pants. my old levi's and even the photos on amazon....showed a somewhat right amount of fold.(am talking about the very bottom edge of the pants where it touches your feet) the folds on the Levi's that i got are so crazy thin.its about a quarter of an inch...as opposed to maybe half an inch...if we base on the photos and the old levi's that i have. this is when i started to feel cheated.the loose stitches i blame on the quality control or maybe the guy in Haiti who did the pants had a bad day. but the bottom fold is really disappointing and its not the same as shown in the pictures.

B000YXC2LI,,"I started wearing Levi's in Junior High School. I've worn them for 5 decades. That ""5"" is not a typo. In recent decades it has been 501s. Some wizard at Levi Strauss decided to ""update the cut"". That means they removed fabric to make them into ""low riders"". The belt line now rides where no adult male wants them to. They are uncomfortable and my shirt won't stay tucked in. They also have two less belt loops. My favorite, ""wear them every day pants"" have gone to hell!

It is interesting to note that some of the positive reviews have female names attached!

What to do? I was killing time in a boutique clothing store while my wife was shopping. They had a tiny men's section. I saw Carhartts on the shelf. I had nothing better to do, so I tried them on. They fit so well, I ignored the high ""boutique"" price. I found a little piece of heaven when I found the part number here on Amazon. Now with a 1-click finger stroke, I get a fresh pair of Carharts  that are comfortable. A half dozen pairs of usable Levi's will be rotting where they are headed.

Those were the originals where you bought them several inches larger and threw them in hot water to shrink them to size. They were a thicker fabric. I have not seen those throw backs in a store in years. So I suspect the company no longer offers those originals anymore. These are still good and in some ways better. They are more comfortable because they don't have that stiff canvas feel of the originals. It took 3 months of washing to get the originals to soften up. They will fit better right off the counter. You still account for a small amount of shrinkage since they are 100% cotton. It is best to wash in cold water.  The dark rinse is a good pant if you want a nicer look.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I remember Levis 501s as great fitting, comfortable, and flattering jeans that wore effortlessly.  After purchasing a new pair, I have decided to assign a two-star rating because the new denim is not comfortable, and the fit (specifically, the low rise) is questionable.  To me, the jeans are tedious to wear.  It may actually be that I would now better appreciate a more relaxed cut.  But especially after looking at other recent Levi's reviews, I'm thinking to involve another brand.  Bottom line: I will keep these jeans since they're wearable and since I've already removed the tags, but I'm thankful to have managed to cancel an order for a second pair.",2,Expected better from Levi's

(Well not exactly the same ones; not the same size, certainly) Same fit, same buttons, same feel, just comfortable jeans. And being able to select any size, style, and color combination through Amazon makes it that much better and easier to own them. How many times have you gone to two or three stores to find they have the right size but the wrong style, or the right style but the wrong color? This was FAR easier to buy and wear this way. Don't know why I didn't think of this before!",5,Some classics are always in fashion

B000YXC2LI,,I liked the color of the jeans and they fit great.  I bought several pair and the fit was generally consistent.,5,501 Jeans
B000YXC2LI,,These were as cheap as I have ever paid for a pair pair of 501s and I ended up buying 4 pairs. They did seen a little stiffer than the 501s I usually buy but maybe thats why I got them for $22.00 a pair,5,Great Price
B000YXC2LI,,I ordered a 35 waist.  They came with a label that said a 35 waist.  But the waist was actually more like a 32.  They were way undersized!,2,Size was mislabeled

B000YXC2LI,,"I was disapointed in the quality of these jeans. First off the fly is not a zipper but metal buttons - perhaps I overlooked that in the description. I bought two pairs and both have a strange streak of white in the right leg above the knee. Its actually in the denim material - not a stain. Also all pockets have excess loose treads on the pocket seems that required cutting off. The fit was fine. Overall, the quality is what you would get for knock off jeans at a discount store - not for premium jeans.",3,Not what I expected
B000YXC2LI,,"I can never find jeans in my size, but I like the way 501s fit.  The jeans show up a little large, but shrink slightly to fit fine.  They hold their color well over several washings.  This is a good color for a dress casual pair of jeans to wear with a collared shirt and sport jacket in an office setting.",5,These fit well and are very comfortable

B000YXC2LI,,My husband's build is not considered big and tall however we can find his pant size in regular either.  42x34.  Needless to say I don't look forward to pant shopping for him.  So I decided to give amazon a try.  I was very hesitant about buying jeans because I was wondering if they would be irregular or of poor quality.  Pleasantly surprised and very satisfied.  501s are his favorite jean style and they were perfect.  Will definitely buy these jeans again.,5,Would order 501 jeans for my husband again
B000YXC2LI,,"They're Levi's... what more do you need to know?  Only reason I order them off Amazon is because it's the only place I can find this size.  In the stores it's all 34"" or 36"" waist and why special order through them (which the usual store employees will stare at you blankly quite often if you ask) when you can just get them here?  Only downside... no sale pricing.",5,Only place I can find 35x30 Levi's.
B000YXC2LI,,"These were a little large. I figure they will shrink or I will get fatter to fill them out... One of the two.

Perfect!",5,Levis...
B000YXC2LI,,Of course fit depends on your body type. For me these fit great. The length and the waist were perfect and jeans look good.,5,great fit
B000YXC2LI,,"These jeans are nice but the seam at the bottom of the pant leg is very narrow.  The hem is less than 1/4 inch and this causes the pant leg to take on some strange shapes.  Not a real big deal as an adult, but as a student in public school I would not wear these.",3,Maybe factory seconds
B000YXC2LI,,I have another pair which is a bit bigger at the waist. The other pair is another color same 501.,3,Waist snug.
B000YXC2LI,,"I was initially worried when ordering these because some styles of newer Levi have been made with sub-par denim. But these are a good thickness and should hold up nicely. The wash is very dark, the stitching is good, and the fit is accurate. The button fly is nice and durable and the pockets are deep enough to fit a modern smart phone comfortably. Happy to report these are some quality Levi jeans, they don't really shrink after a washing so expect to order the size you actually need.",5,Quality Levi jeans
B000YXC2LI,,"Levi's makes great jeans, there is no denying that.  I know the risk you take when buying any clothing on-line.  This is the second pair I have bought.  The first ones were perfect.  This last pair fits more like a 34 than a 35 but that's what you get for buying clothes without trying them on first.  Still, the quality is as good as Levi's reputation.  I will likely purchase another pair on line and take my chances.  I need a 35 waist and those are hard to find in the stores.",3,Levi's 501 Original Fit

B000YXC2LI,,three days of wearing and they are break! It's not a Levi's quality. Last one pair I used about 5 years.,1,It's a fake
B000YXC2LI,,"It has been along time since I have work 501's and I was a bit hesitant because of the button fly, but it took wearing them for about an hour and the memory kicked back in, and there are no problems with the button fly.  Great fit, looks great and good Levi jeans.",5,Still Classic

B000YXC2LI,,"I have purchased these for over 30 years for my husband and just like a man, change is not an option. Pleased with the accessibility of getting them on Amazon.",5,Just like getting them at JCPennys.
B000YXC2LI,,"As I read all the negative reviews of these Levi's, how the material was thinner than usual and the unusual wrinkles in the back and the front, I hoped that I would find these pants exactly that way.  I am a solo piano player and play many gigs in my area, and I wanted some black pants that were less heavy than regular black Levi's. I choose these polished black pants, hoping that they would be between dress pants and the regular Levi variety, and these are perfect.  The rivets are black, too, which I really like, and like all 501 Levi's, which I have been wearing as far back as I can remember (I'm now 70 years old), they fit perfectly.  I will definitely be ordering a second pair of these pants.",5,Exactly what I was hoping for!
B000YXC2LI,,"these jeans fit well, for those of you who like the Thicker Levi's you will be disappointed with these since the material is very thin, personally I like that but they aren't what they used to be as far as quality of material.  Other then that they fit  and look good.",5,Nice but thinner material used.
B000YXC2LI,,I have been wearing these pants since I was a teenager and they have actually gotten better over the years because they have stone-washed them so they are soft and faded from day one and no longer take months to break in and fade. One of life's great small pleasures.,5,You Cannot Go Wrong With 501s
B000YXC2LI,,"The problem with Levis is that they have terrible quality control. 501 button down jeans should have the same number of buttons on every pair that I order. Some have more, some have less and some are in different positions. The other problem with this pair of jeans is that within two weeks of ordering on of the belt loops came loose. I will try to return these.",1,Not as happy with Levis as I used to be...
B000YXC2LI,,"I can only echo what other reviewers have written here.  These are NOT Levi's 501s.

I would have paid far more for a jean that last like the 501s I used to wear and fits and looks as good.

These are a lighter fabric, crinklier, just not the same item at all.

It is sad.  Another icon is gone.  And where can I now find good-looking, durable jeans?",2,They destroyed an American standard
B000YXC2LI,,"Despite what I have read on other reviews, I think these Jeans are a good value. I only rated them 4 stars because they feel somewhat lighter than those I use to get years ago, but then again, everything on the market has gone that way as well. The fit is what I have always expected in STF Jeans and am very pleased with them. I can get my exact size thru Amazon, whereas I typically cannot find anything in my size at the big box stores, and the mom & pop stores that are left don't carry them anymore.",4,"Form, Fit & Function"

B000YXC2LI,,"I've learned a valuable lesson: When ordering jeans, read the fine print.  I would have sworn there was no mention of a button fly; but when I received the jeans I went back and looked and there it was.  Since the last time I confronted a button fly was in the 1940s, I was not conditioned to be wary of inadvertently ordering such pants.  Levi's, there was a reason the button fly was replaced by a zipper.  The passage of time has not brought back the 'charm' of such an antiquated device.  If you're a septuagenarian as I am, with arthritic hands, DO NOT order these jeans.",2,Button Fly?
B000YXC2LI,,"Have purchased online at least six pair of 501s over the past year that HAD to be bogus; thin material, lousy fit, weird dye. Threw 3 pair away after washing and am washing the heck out of three more in hopes they'll shape up; if not,, they're going in the trash too.  Since I've been wearing 501s for 40 years, I was getting very worried that Levis had screwed the pooch.

Trial purchased one pair here and as soon as I wash them and tried them on, purchased two more pair.

Yes, the last four pair I have purchased from Amazon and they last about six-to-eight months. The inseam has torn on two pair, making them unwearable. And this is only from casual use!!! I remember the days when I used to wear Levi's as a work pant, and they would last through years of heavy abuse. Now, with this thinner material, you could easily destroy a brand new pair by just getting into a car.
I will certainly check the quality of Levi's 501 at a local store, but if it's the same paper thin junk that Amazon sells, I will have no other choice but to find a new brand. I still find it hard to believe that my brand has been totally ruined.",1,Thin material rips early and often.

The pair I bought February 15th--one month and eight days ago--have already split from the bottom all the way to the zipper. I always thought I bought denim because it was tougher than normal cloth.

However as someone who used to own multiple pairs of 501's years ago I was sorely disappointed.  The cut is not what it used to be.  These pants should have fit my butt perfectly, but it seems the cut is now a bit saggy in the butt and crotch.  The material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what I remember too.  Original fit???  Shrink to fit???  Nope nada no way!  I have already washed them and there was no shrink to fit.  My pair of jeans were made in Malaysia.

I recommend going to a brick and mortar store and trying out various brands and sizes as Levi's which I used to be able to buy just by size is no longer what it used to be.

I was very pleased to see that the styling was slightly updated and this turned out to be an even better pair of jeans than I expected.

The one downside I found was the button fly.  This didn't bother me soo much when I was younger but now I would much prefer a zipper to dealing with buttons.  Perhaps it is because I generally wear a belt now and it is very difficult to do the buttons up without undoing the belt and top button.",4,Can't beat a classic.

B000YXC2LI,5.0,"The last time we purchased Levis (which the man has worn for decades) we were highly disappointed in the fabric, which was the dark blue.  We were very cautious about another buy; read reviews on Amazon and found some similar poor remarks.  In the meanwhile, we visited a major retailer and could see that there were various ""washes"" which relate to the softness, overall wearability of the fabric.  So we were careful to choose the Medium Stonewash, which came out of the dryer in a ready-to-wear condition.  So, don't yet give up on Levis.  We think this pair will fit and wear like the ones we were accustomed to in the past.",4,We were concerned...

Mexico always makes the pants that fit perfectly for whatever size needed. I gained weight and needed 35"" waisted pants, something impossible to find in stores, so I ended up buying them from The Levi's Store online - and never had a problem with the sizing. I've now lost some weight and need 33"" waisted pants. Just bought 2 pair from Amazon (they were about the same cost but 2 day free shipping on Amazon). The other pair was 33""x32"" 501s called ""Bleached"" - tried them on - and PERFECT. Checked the tag and yup - made in Mexico. (On a side note, Amazon's website shows that ALL their 501s are made in Mexico which is a total lie). When I tried this pair on, they were TIGHT! Aside from barely able to getting them up, the button-up fly eyes weren't the normal size - I could barely get the button through the buttonhole on every single button. Got them all buttoned up and - ack - I could barely breath! Had just as much problem getting the button fly OPEN as I did closing it - then it took an extra hand to peel the pant leg off. I checked the tag and - made in Mexica? HAHAHA, no, no, no. They were made in Egypt! Any pants I've receive made in Egypt, Burma, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia - anywhere but Mexico - they are too small!

But let's not speak of the discrepancy on Amazons part re: that I bought Levi 501 34x32 the first time and the second time yet Amazon begins their strange and rude requirement by printing in large type that I bought 33x32.

Honestly, I cannot for the life of me imagine why they would ""require""d anything of a customer who's paid his bill, and then to do so when Amazon cannot get their facts straight. I'd call this a careless error followed by an insult. We, your customers butter your bread, that is, after we provide the bread.

B000YXC2LI,5.0,"As many reviewers have noted these are not the Levi's 501s of old.  At all.  Below I will list several characteristics that make them inferior, but, in the end, they're okay jeans, I guess.  Just not Levi's 501s.  In other words, they're sturdy enough and aren't falling apart.  And they have the classic Levi's label.  But they aren't the Levi's we grew up with.  At all.  Here's why:

--Inferior fabric.  The denim used is not as thick, not even close, and the ""weave"" (I don't know the technical term) isn't as good as you can see a sort of grain in the fabric that are clearly indicative of inferior fabric.  It's not super thin, but it's not nearly as heavy as classic Levi's.

--Fewer belt loops!  I know, right?!  There are two belt loops on the front, like normal, and two on the side.  Then, where there are normally two on the back that are opposite the two front ones, and then a middle one in the back?  The two opposite the front ones are eliminated!  So, you go from two side loops to one in the back.  That's it!  And it's not that the other two back ones fell off or something, they just aren't there.  Why?  I'm guessing that after several dozen pair of jeans you save enough fabric that way to make another pair.  Heck if I know, but it's annoying.  You might not think it would be, but, I have to say, I notice it every single time I put them on.

--The feel is wrong.  This is probably a repeat of the fabric listing above, but it kind of requires repeating.  The fabric just isn't as sturdy, so they don't feel like Levi's.  They feel cheap.  And that's a shame.

Again, as I say, if you're just after a pair of jeans with a Levi's label with your waist and inseam size printed on it, these will work and from a distance they look enough like classic Levi's that I reckon they'll do.  But if you're after a pair of classic Levi's 501s, don't buy these.  They aren't the jeans you're looking for.  Not even close.",2,"Okay as jeans, but these are *not* the Levi's 501s you grew up with"

B000YXC2LI,,"In my quest for the perfect pair of 501's I have discovered that the quality varies widely by the country of origin.  If I had to rank the countries that I have seen listed on 501 tags, I would rank them as:

Turkey >= Dominican Republic >> Mexico

OBSERVATIONS BY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:

Turkey -- I bought this pair of 501's at the Levi store in London, England on Regent Street.  The quality is higher than I have observed at any retail store in the United States.  The fabric is heavy yet soft, and the stitching appears to be high quality.  Bought without hesitation.

Dominican Republic -- I bought this pair of 501's at a T.J. Maxx store in the United States.  The quality is on par with that of Turkey above, yet they were sold at T.J. Maxx due to a minor irregularity in the fabric near the bottom of one leg.  Bought without hesitation.

Mexico -- I have seen 501's for sale that were manufactured in Mexico.  The fabric is significantly thinner/lighter and more flexible.  Stitching appeared clumsy rather than precise.  Did not buy.

The quest for perfect 501's continues.  I will update this review as I discover more.",5,WARNING:  Quality varies widely by country of origin

For decades my favorite jeans of all time. Countless designers and brands have tried to tap into the 501's iconic popularity but at the end of the day have always failed to do so.

These are exactly how I remember them:

* Heavy Denim

* Re-enforced flawless stitching on all pockets, hems, waist line and inner leg.

* Solid brass rivets on pockets

* The classic brass rivet button fly

Ordered in white these arrived quickly, wrapped in plastic with tags of authenticity. The fit and feel is marvelous and the price is sensational. Macy's and other stores sell 501's for twice this amount. The slim fit isn't constrictive nor are they pre-washed so expect a few washings before they feel like a second skin.

I ordered this SPECIFIC pair because of the washed out color... It says ""light"" stonewash and that is what I wanted. But what arrived was the regular stone-washed color; you know, slightly faded but not the ""light"" stonewash I wanted and they picture here. There were quite a few variations of stonewash to choose from, but I'm unhappy with this purchase as I already had a pair of the regular stonewash and was looking forward to something different. It says in the script of the product ""no control over color"", or ""colors will vary""... but if that's the case then just eliminate this ""light"" color and go with the regular that you are shipping!
I'm unhappy!",2,no control on color

I'm wondering if they save money by using less mat'l--making Levi's tighter, or...is it today's fashion trends dictating their behavior? Dunno! What I know is that my legs used to feel good in 501's now...they feel cramped! Had to go to 550's (relaxed fit)--w/only drawback is zipper fly v buttons. But they now feel good w/same waist&length!

I know the pants I like.  my wife convinced me that we could go to the mall and get them cheap because she had a coupon.  first of all couldn't find the size I wear in the color I wanted, and then at checkout we found that the coupon had small print that excluded Levi.  got home went to amazon, found the pants at a great price, free shipping with Prime and I had them in 2 days.  It will be  along time before I waste 2 hours of my life going to the mall to get Levi's again.  Amazon Rocks.",5,Exactly what i expected

I wanted a pair of jeans to wear with shoes as the 527 is the model i usually buy for the boots. In my opinion these are the perfect model that will match with loafers. I find the 527 to be too loose to wear with shoes. I don't know if all 501 come with button flys but mine did and it was a pleasant surprise for me as i prefer them to zippers which might be faster and more convenient but to paraphrase Seinfeld, this part of my body can do without interlocking metal teeth.",5,Nice fit

I didn't bother to read any reviews because I trusted Levi's.  While I was waiting on delivery I did read some reviews which I was surprised to find were often negative.  When they arrived they were too short and one leg was shorter.  They were 30 X 29, but when I measured the inseams they were  26.5 and 27.  also the legs seemed small in the calf area, and I weigh 132 pounds.

B000YXC2LI,,"When I was a teen, Levi's 501s were my go-to jeans. It took me 25 years to realize the wisdom of my youth.

A lot of niche brands have come and gone, but they are more expensive, lower quality, and fad-based. Skinny jeans? Ornate pocket designs? Bell-bottoms? Have at it. These 501s never go out of style and they last a long time.

The waist runs a little big, but fits to size after the first wash.",5,Still the best jeans on the market

The Levi's 501 button fly jeans are the only jeans that I wore in the last 10 years since they fit me well, and I buy an average of a pair a year. This is the first time I purchase the jeans from Amazon though. I have to say that the material of these jeans are a lot thinner than any of the jeans I have purchased. The cut seems to be a little smaller too, but enough for me to send it back for an exchange to a size bigger.

I hope that this is an abnormality specific to this seller, and not a change in the overall quality that Levi's decided to go with. If it is, I have to start trying out other brands to find something that fits me better.",2,Change in quality and material

B000YXC2LI,,"The drop down menu for ""How does it fit?"" didn't include an option for ""horribly"", so I thought I would say it here.

The stitching is off, the tags are off, and they crinkle like bacon around the waist and ankles. I think Levis should call up Michael Jordan to help them out with their bacon waist.

These pants feel like Levis hired some fly by night operation to throw some denim together in the shape of pants. They failed.",1,Get the skillet... we got us some bacon waist.

Now the denim is the cheapest, thinnest, denim they can get away with selling, which explains why they wear out so fast. They also used to be sewn with a beautiful golden thread. Not anymore! Now they appear to be made in China. Very sad to see a quality product go so far down hill.",2,Sad . . .

B000YXC2LI,,"As a life-long 501s wearer here's my two cents:

About the fabric: several reviewers have complained that the fabric is much thinner than the original 501s. That's true. They're not paper thin, but not they're not like the originals. These won't last years like they used to. They're like any jeans you might buy from Gap, Old Navy, etc.

About the fit: In the old days they were ""shrink to fit"", or ""preshrunk"" these jeans are tagged ""Original Fit"". I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, but basically, they're preshrunk. They fit right out of the box. Order the size you'd normally wear. They'll arrive soft, comfy and ready to wear.

Some reviewers have complained that they fit ""snug"". Unfortunately, I have to disagree. In fact, Levis changed their ""secret sauce"" several years ago with 501s for the EXACT OPPOSITE reason Americans are fat they also changed the logo on the back pocket. If you'll notice, present day 501s logo have a deeper chevron than the originals. At the time of this design change Levi widen the seat of the pants to make room for our Big Mac eating behinds. Staggering, but true. I'm sure about thisat the time I ran out to stores and bought several pairs of the truly ""original"" 501s and that supply lasted me decades.

So, they may be snug compared to something else, but compared to the 501s of the 90s, 80s, 70s, and 60s, these jeans are looser in the seat.

Gave 'em 4 stars because the negative reviews are true: They're not the original. They're not as good but what is these days? This as good as it gets.",4,As Good As It Gets
B000YXC2LI,,I ordered two pairs of these and the price is very good compared to department stores in this area.  The quality is equal to that of the department stores.  Love them and order a third pair.  The fit is perfect.,5,Love them.

Myself, I like the reminder of my youth, when zippers were not that dependable and young guys liked the security of the four buttons there to sheild your bulge, even if you left one undone occasionally.  Young girls would notice that and you might get a sly look and a smile.  But, I digress, my love of button fly Levis will go on, past when I will need to comb my hair back on the way out of the bathroom, or even tuck in my teeshirt or worry the fade has gone on to some legit wear holes, earned from many wearings and washings.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I have tried all types of jeans throughout my years but always go back to 501's. I like the fit, the button fly can't break like a zipper and they have a classic look. One of the things that is different from the ones I wore 30 years ago is all of the colors available now and what seems to me like different types of cotton for each color. Some seem more like a woven cotton and some like a knit. And the more like a knit that they are the more they stretch out when you wear them. You can wash and dry them and they fit fine but after an hour of wear, (sit down stand up bend and kneel) the butt is all baggy and stretched out and the legs as well but I guess this is the case with most jeans. When you wear a belt with them, the belt seems to ride up and cause a weird situation where it is above the waistline of the jeans and into your boxers. This is made worse with thin belts. I think a couple of more belt loops would help with this.. I never liked the big brown ""leather?"" size tag on the back either. It always looked like something that should be ripped off after purchase but of course it is not meant to be and is stitched on tight. I can live with that and as for the stretching out, I will by a size smaller next time.",4,They have evolved over time.

B000YXC2LI,,"I mostly wear Levi's 501 Shrink-to-Fit jeans nowadays and have for years, but I purchased a pair of pre-shrunk 501's because I liked the wash. The color/wash I purchased was called ""Aged Perfect"", which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures. The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.

Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.

The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past. Unfortunately, I'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501's. This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2"" too long. This isn't a huge deal, because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better, anyway.

Overall, I'm mostly pleased with them, but I still prefer STF's and probably won't be buying another pair of these anytime soon.",4,Compared to STF's

Fit- very tricky, I've worn them for years, so I know sometimes you have to try a couple pairs in the same size to get them right,.
I know  to go up a size from my regular size in other pants. The only issue is if you need a not too common size as I do, your color selection gets very limited.
I'm not sure some of the tricky sizing is the result of moving production  overseas or what.
Other then this sizing and quality control issue, 501's are in a class by themselves. There are 501's, and then there are all the others.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've owned Levis for decades but doubt I'll be buying more.  Ordered a replacement pair for one that was getting worn and was shocked by the difference in size, especially the inseam.  I laid the new pair on the floor and put old one over it, lined up the waists and then measured how much longer the new pair was -- 4 inches!!!!!  No wonder they were under my feet when I put them on.  So, I have joined others who have criticized the quality of the fit. Maybe Levi Strauss thinks they can live on their reputation but such thinking can lead to ruin -- think Pinto, Wang computers.......

8 Dec 13:  I complained to Levis and they said I could send them in to be checked (at my expense) and if my complaints were valid they would replace.  Sent them (w/photo showing defective ones side by side w/2 pair I've had for some time).  Levis agreed that they were defective, confirmed what I wanted for replacements (size, color, etc.) and they arrived and met expectations.  Should not have had to come to this but they did act once I informed them of the problems I encountered.",1,can't Levi Strauss measure consistently

B000YXC2LI,,"Received my 501's really fast and tried them on. It was like saying hello to an old friend.  These jeans fit me so well!  501's have a much more substantial feel than other jeans, still soft and comfortable though.  After a wash shrinkage was minimal and the fit was still great for me. I couldn't be happier with these 501's. local stores never have my size (32x29) so I was willing to gamble on mail order... glad I did!",5,Like An Old Friend

B000YXC2LI,,"Fit as expected. Great fit for me and can always find my size other places. If you need them, they get to you fast.",5,Love my 501's
B000YXC2LI,,This particular style has a bit of a different texture than the traditional 501's.  I like them because they are a bit dressier and can be occasionally worn to the office as well as for casual wear.,5,Levis...always a classic.
B000YXC2LI,,"Levis 501 jeans fit body well, last a long time, and are comfortable.  Got some black ones this time, and they are a nice for an occasion that requires a cut above the regular blue jean.",5,Product As Expected
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I have been trying to get a few pairs of 501 Originals (which is not the shrink to fit variety) that fit me, and have found the sizing of 501 Originals to be all over the map for jeans that all were labled 32w x 36L or 38L. In varying degrees, all--ALL--had waists that were bigger than 32. And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall (one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize, that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up).
Some were a little longer than specified, some were a lot longer than specified (far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing: I'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings, than find that after a few washings they are too short).

Most had strange front rises that caused, in varying degrees, the dreaded codpiece bulge (which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both--the bulge is not always symmetrical--inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward); the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color, which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake, but the second pair was just as bad: the Timberwolf's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side: hideous!

As for the button fly--that turned out to be the best thing. I've found the button fly to be very comfortable, more comfortable than a zipper. The buttons are no problem once you get the knack of them and once the jeans are broken in.

My dimensions are 73.5"" tall and 160lbs.  And of all the 501 Originals I've ordered, the best fitting is the Dark Stonewash in 32x36.  But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much, I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L--and guess what: that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly.  I give up.

ADDITIONAL INFO: the different colors the 501 Originals come in, are not all made from the same denim weight.  If you go to Levi's website, you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there.  Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day.  It's only a bad if you didn't realize you were ordering it.

ONE MORE THING: 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans, which are 501 Original Fit.  The 501 Original fit will behave pretty much like all other Levis that are not Shrink to Fit jeans.  Many people reviewing these Original Fit 501s didn't realize they were ordering the wrong jeans.  Again, Levi's website explains the distinction.",2,Dark Stonewash: The Best of the Worst
B000YXC2LI,,"This is NOT my first pair and won't be the last. The 501 jeans have always had the best fit. I have tried other levi's but always come back to the 501. The colors can be really hard to see in the amazon pics, I ordered the Tidal Blue because it looked the most like a regular dark blue Levi. They are a slightly different color than i expected but i actually like them more than the old school dark blue.

First couple of washes i hang dry them  and will usually dry on low-medium heat from then on.",5,With Levi's 501 you can't go wrong...
B000YXC2LI,,"Jeans fit my husband well, thick jeans not thin and cheap, but I did notice that the Levi tag (small red one on the pocket) was stitched upside down, but barely noticeable.",4,Good Jeans
B000YXC2LI,3.0,"I wear Levi's pretty much everywhere, and have been using the 501's 34x32 for a while (now that I'm a grown up and all) - Maybe I have to wait until these ones stretch a little, Overall a very good product.",4,A little tight on the crotch area

B000YXC2LI,,"I read a previous review of someone disappointed with the softer, changed fabric in the blue 501's. I understand what he meant. I have several pairs of black 501's that I can wear for several days and they stay neat and crisp. These are softer and sag more quickly and do not retain the same crispness, a disappointment since I run a contracting business and appearance is important when meeting clients and prospective clients. So, I have to do my laundry more often.",3,"OK, but not as stiff a fabric as the several other pairs of black 501's previously pruchased"
B000YXC2LI,,"I know these are not the Levi's of old, but they are great jeans, especially for the price compared to similar fitting and styled jeans.  I'll save $100- $200 on a pair of jeans even if they aren't as high quality as they used to be.  Especially considering my other pair of these I picked up in an outlet have lasted for almost 3 years now with no wear and tear issues.",5,Exactly What I expected

B000YXC2LI,,Made in Egypt. I wasn't expecting that!  Fabric is thinner than I remember from the old days. Fit is as expected.,4,Imported.
B000YXC2LI,,What can you say about Levi's.  They are great.  I've worn mostly 501's since I was a kid. Wash them in cold water and they will hold their color and fit until you wear them out.,5,Great Jeans

B000YXC2LI,,"I returned the jeans because the jeans I received were NOTHING like the jeans as pictured. The jeans I received did not have a fly front with  zipper. Instead, it was a button front, with metal button which were impossible to button. Not only that, they were poorly constructed, one seam beginning to unravel even though they were new. I have purchased jeans made in Mexico before, but these were so poorly made  one might call them shoddy.",1,Levi Duds!
B000YXC2LI,,You just can't go wrong with Levi's. This is the third pair of black Levi's jeans I've bought for my teen (he outgrows them so fast!). You can dress them up or wear them casually. They keep their color well after several washes and uses. Excellent jeans.,5,Great pair of jeans
B000YXC2LI,3.0,"I called Levi and they call it updated - Yep, they changed the way Levi's are made!

Thinner material, single stitch on inside leg along with many other defects.

These are totally inferior to what we are use to!",1,PURE and SIMPLE CORPORATE GREED!!!
B000YXC2LI,,It's Levi's.  How can you go wrong.  I still like the button fly vs zipper and the fact that the lengths are in odd sizes so you can get a better fit of the even size pants are a bit too short or long.,5,Best Jeans

B000YXC2LI,,"I had a pair of 501`s a few years back and they fitted perfectly. But having ordered these on the internet from USA in the same size as before 33/34, I find the fit completely different. Namely, there is so much fabric in the backside, it`s like carrying a extra bag on your behind. Given that the average American is statistically bigger than other countries I can only assume it was made for the domestic customer.

My recommendation is if you are from outside USA, don't trust these to be the size of your home country. They weren`t for me and now I have to find someone to tailor them to locate my backside again. Disappointing. 2 stars because the colour and fabric are great.",2,american sizes (and shapes)
B000YXC2LI,,"I noticed a lot of complaining regarding fit and weight of the denim so I went to Levis web site and checked out all the different washes and different weights of each style denim. These were a gift for my daughters boyfriend who wears a 34 and the 34 fit perfectly, they were not tight in the leg or calf (he has muscular rugby legs) and the wash was a very nice dark indigo with no wiskering, can easily be worn when you want to dress up a little nicer with out wearing dress pants. Once washed the pants shrank one inch in length but the width was the same.",5,awesome

I went to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, NY thinking they would have the real McCoy's. Boy, was I disappointed. They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax. I wouldn't even consider all the pretty reds and greens and blues. Levi's were always made for men. Now it seems they are mad for 'funny' men. Even the blue jean material felt thin and cheap. I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper. They don't have all the cuts and 'pretty' colors that Levi's do but if I'm buying jeans I don't want funny colors and weird fits. NO MORE LEVI'S!",1,No More Levi's

These jeans, now called ""Rinse,"" are the true, original, classic Levi's 501 jeans. If you are impatient, I suppose you can order the ""stonewashed,"" and you'll get the same thing, except already battered and faded. Okay, if that's what you want. Mine fade to the same shade over time. But mine last longer.

These true, original, classic Levi's 501 jeans do not come in white, or black, or any other colors of the rainbow no matter how fanciful and attractive the name may seem (Blue Mist? Timberwolf? Iced Glass?). You order something else, you are not getting the true, original classic. So don't complain if you don't get the true original classic. You didn't order them. You ordered something else.

I've just received two pair. Both hecho en Mejico. Both the same, thick, durable fabric I've known for decades. Both fit as they always have. Both are sturdily stitched with copper rivets around the pocket seams (and steel riveted buttons on the fly). Both are true, original, classics.

I see other reviews disparaging Levi's 501s. Some complain these have a button-fly, not a zipper. Well, duh. Such folk not only didn't know what they were ordering, they didn't read the item description either. Other folk, however, seem to think that Levi's 501 jeans should be the color of a rain-soaked chrysanthemum and still be ""original."" Hmmm. What to think of such folk?

You want the best, the original, the classic? Order Levi's 501 Jeans, ""Rinse."" That's what you'll get. Order something else? Well...it's your money.",5,"The real, original classic....not some fancy-schmanzy pastel or plaid"

B000YXC2LI,,We received the order promptly and the product was acceptable.  The only issue was the description was not as accurate as we had expected.  These are prewashed or processed products and not the shrink to fit fabric which we had expected thus everyone should take that into account when ordering.  Commonly the shrink to fit Levi 501 has a crisper hand and you know to expect the dimensions to change when laundering.  They may be too large if you have the wrong concept about the product you are receiving.,4,levi order

I finally took the time with these last 2 pair I've ordered & measured seam to seam on the front of each leg. From the crotch, 16 in. down, the left leg was 8.25 in across & the right leg was 8.0 in across - so there's the prob. - since the fit seems the same, the back of the leg fabric must be cut to larger to make up for the shortage on the front.

B000YXC2LI,11.0,"Ok, so based on other reviews, people are ordering jeans online and are fed up with a poor fit. Even If you go to a Levis store and try on 2 of the exact same size jeans, they will fit a tad different. I do agree that over the years, Levis has changed its factories(Bring em back to America please! We need the jobs!), changed its fabrics, etc. Times do change, but these are still great jeans. Below is my experience buying 2 pairs of 501's from this listing on Amazon. I bought the Tidal Blue, and the Dimensional rigid. Both of them in 32x32. They arrive, and look awesome! I bought a pair of the FROGGY before these, and they were paper thin and wore out in a matter of months. Not to be detoured, I ordered the 2, Tidal, and Dimensional. The Tidal blue fit flawlessly to the size I expected them to be, 32x32. The weight of the jean is heavy and full like levis should be for good life wear. The Dimensional Rigid are another story. They were alot thinner than the tidal blue, and the waist fits more like a 30 or 31, and the legs fit like a baggy jeans instead of straight like the tidals.

All that to say, when doing a review, please make sure you specify which version of Levis you got, the weight, feel, wash, etc...Maybe we can reduce this thing down to the pair that fits like Levis should. I LOVE the tidal blue, hence 5 stars. And, just to be sure it was not a fluke, I ordered another pair a month later. Fits exactly like the others, and the wash and print is identical. Good job, Levis. I am buying another pair soon, just so I will have my favorite pair of jeans at all times! I wear them everyday of the week when able. the just keep getting better.

My other jeans from a different brand (but same price point) are much more substantial to the touch/much higher quality...these Levi 501s are so cheap they are almost stretchy like women's jeans when they want it hugging their figure.  That brings me to another point...these jeans are way too tight.  I'm a skinny guy and I did NOT like how skinny these jeans were through the leg...barely any slack and it's not like I have big legs or something.  The button crotch instead of a zipper is a joke too...hard to undo/redo.

The first time I washed them I did so by hand and let them drip dry and they were as new.  The second time they were washed was in the machine at 30 degrees with a gentle colour detergent, unfortunately there was colour fade in a few areas on the legs even though as always I washed them inside out as advised.

My advice is never put these jean in a washing machine to maintain the colour.",3,Washing Warning!!!!!

But no more....

The last dozen pair of these jeans I've purchased in the last 7 years have fallen apart within 2-3 months of purchase. The material is flimsy, the stitching is weak, and the belt loops have  pulled out of every pair. This seems to have coincided with the move to offshore labor, and the last  four I bought were made in either Haiti or Egypt, of all places. I have a few other pairs purchased in the mid 1990s that are still as solid as the day I bought them, and I'd be wearing them today if my waistline hadn't expanded by a couple of inches.

Check out All American Clothing for jeans made in the USA with cotton that you can trace back to the grower (mine were grown in Texas). The ""classic"" and ""straight leg"" cuts are both nice and comparable to Levis 501s. The ""straight leg"" are equivalent to 501s, while the ""classic"" is also straight leg but lower rise.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"At first glance, these appeared to be a normal pair of pre-washed black 501s, with the familiar cardboard tags, however on closer inspection, the fabric was very thin, with a very un-denim-like texture, the rivets were black rather than copper colored, and most tellingly the red tag on the right hip pocket did not say ""Levis"". ALL genuine Levis have the red tag, and they ALWAYS have the word ""LEVIS"" printed on them. The jeans were also weirdly wrinkled along the front of the crotch and top of thighs, as though the wrinkles were deliberately induced, but the texture was sort of stiff and crackly. I'm pretty sure these are counterfeit Levis. We sent them back for credit, ordered another pair of black 501s from another vendor and got a normal, correct pair of 501s with all the expected attributes.

This vendor should be looked into for selling fake merchandise.",1,Counterfeit?
B000YXC2LI,,I have had basically the same problem with every pair of these Levis I have bought. The belt loops seem to be pretty cheap?

Compared to the 505's, these actually sit at the waist and are sized correctly.  The 501's also use a heavier denim than the 505's, 550's, etc.  The button fly was not my first choice, but this way I don't have to deal with the cheap zipper used in the current 505's.  Did I mention that Levi's are not the same quality product they were just a few short years ago?  The biggest difference between these 501's and the legacy 501's (and all other styles of Levi's jeans) is the missing belt loops.  There used to be 2 additional loops in the back, between the center loop and the 2 side loops.  Somehow they just don't feel right without those other 2 loops.",4,501 Levi's

I don't wear skinny jeans, I don't like the feel of pants that are too tight - which these are. The saving grace I guess is that the color is a nice deep blue wash so they do look good but for a everyday pair of jeans which is what I was expecting to get out of Levi's these aren't really cutting the mustard; I have had much better jeans.",3,Stiff and tight

B000YXC2LI,,These are the preshrunk button fly jeans that fit at the waist.  I needed them to shrink a bit and have washed them 12 times in hot water and still they are a little big in the waist.  Too bad nobody sells jeans in the odd number waist sizes.  Still my wife loves the look.  Very happy with this purchase.,5,Great jeans; great price
B000YXC2LI,,"I am amongst the hundreds of people who hate the fit change Levi's made to the 505's. The old trusted ""standard"" fit zip fly 505 was changed to ""regular"" fit, including a drop in the waist. I agree that the lower rise waist is a deal-breaker for those who prefer a straight leg jean that fits ""at the waist"". My solution, just get the original fit 501! It's just a great normal fitting jean for normal guys. Yes, the button fly is a bit of a pain, but well worth the trouble to have a jean that fits like my former old favorite, the 505. Plus, my wife is happy, she says 501's are what hottie's wear!",5,Pant's for those who hate the new 505's.
B000YXC2LI,,"First, these jeans are quite comfortable. But.... I didn't read the description closely enough. When I hurriedly put them on preparing to leave the house for an appointment I was taken aback to discover that they had a button fly. I just went with them figuring that since I wore this type when I was a kid (before zippers were firmly established), I can deal with it. We'll see how that plays out. I do prefer ordering online since it is a 60 mile trek to go to the ""big city"" but sometimes being able to look closely before purchasing can be a good thing. Oh well.......",3,My Bad

The low rise are good if you are thin with a narrow behind. Levi's 501 are regular fit and straight leg. They tend to run about an inch too long, so if you inseam is 34 get 32 to 33.

After wearing a few times now they fit much better, so I am glad I was patient.

Well after a month and a half of wear I have a hole in the jeans in one of the seams. Very disapointed in the quality of these jeans now. I bought 2 pair so hoping the other pair last longer.

B000YXC2LI,,"Reason being I tried them on in the wash I ordered (and even then I probably just got lucky). Been wearing 501s forever but I only own one, maybe two pairs at a time. I wear them until there's nothing left, then get another pair. Right now I've had one pair for the last two years. They've never seen a washing machine and are only OCCASIONALLY rinsed off in a cold tub and left to drip dry. (Say what you will about hygiene but I'm left with the most comfortable, best fitting jeans this way.) Unfortunately nowadays you can pick up four or five pair of Levi's in different colors and washes, all marked the same size, and you'll find that a few are super baggy, and a couple are so tight you can't even fasten them, but MAYBE one pair will fit like an old glove. Buy that pair and you won't regret it.

Kind of makes buying online impossible, which is extra annoying since the places in town that sell them mark them up to almost $80 and then run a ""sale"" that puts them around $10-15 more than the prices on Amazon, and even those places only carry a few washes/colors.

I'm giving five stars to my particular pair of trusty old 501s. I sincerely hope I can find another pair as good.",5,Only fit as expected for one reason

B000YXC2LI,,I usually go for the more faded look. These really have a dressy look.  Much darker and almost a shine to them.  MAKE SURE you wash them alone prior to washing with others.  The legs felt almost tight at first but stretch to fit very quickly.  Very true to fit as other Levi 501's I have purchased.  I personally think the Levi's are thinner than they used to be but for these that's OK as it gives them a dressy look.,5,Could be dress jeans

B000YXC2LI,,"I love 501 jeans, they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper.  Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean (there is a plain black 501 as well).  The polished finish produces a shiny, more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean.  If that happens, the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water, wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.

The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the ""give"" in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes.",4,Neat Appearance but tight fit
B000YXC2LI,,"really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it",5,it's Perfect

B000YXC2LI,,"so light, material quality is not good, can't match the popularity it has been created. i am disappointed for 501",3,i am disappointed
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"There are Levis and then there is everything else. Jeans should have the Levis stitching, tab and patch on the back or they are simply something else. Having said that, buying Levis is not easy. The styles are named with numbers, but over time the shape of the jeans changes. Today's 501s are not the same shape as 501s from a few years ago, and my 501s are much wider below the knee than the photos of 501s on Amazon or on Levis.com. Not the same at all. And I bought mine in the Levis store in Beverly Hills where they cost more money, and I still had to try on several to get the right size, and the sizes printed on the patches is only a rough guide.

Most reviews here focus on the offshore production and quality issues. I have not had any quality issues with any foreign made Levis so far. But I have had issues with sizing consistency, which is why buying jeans online is not worth the trouble of returns and exchanges. Sort it out in a store's fitting room before you ever buy them.

Today's fashion is for a slimmer jean, but if you try a 514 Slim Straight you will see that not only are they slimmer, but they also have too much fabric at the butt and they want to sit lower, and the pockets are too low. 505 Straight Fits, which in theory should be la lot like 501s with a zipper, are completely different from 501s. The 505s that I tried, while all slightly different in shape, all had a bizarre flare at the outside of the thighs, a much narrower leg opening, a slimmer lower leg, and again, they want to sit at the hip and give you a big empty space at the butt. The pockets are so low that your legs look a foot shorter. Not attractive at all. Perhaps if your thighs, hips and buttocks are more plentiful and curvaceous the 505s may fit more normally. They may be called Straight but they are not for straight figures, quite the opposite. You need fat and curves to fill them out. 505s fit quite terribly for my figure, except for the black ones, which share only the name 505 with the denim ones.

So the age-old classic 501s still flatter the typical male form the best, despite being quite wide-legged by today's standards. But again, if you have saved your old jeans over the years, you will clearly see that 501s are always changing. The waist rises and falls and tapers in and out in relation to the hips, the legs widen and narrow, the pockets get larger and smaller and higher and lower, and further apart and closer together, and only the name remains constant over time. And no revision warnings are ever issued.

One other reason to try on and buy in a store, 501's come in many colors and almost no two are made from the same fabric. There are so many different weights of denim, each with a different fit, that you have to compare the fabrics by standing, sitting and squatting in a fitting room. So take a quiet weekday morning off, go to a department store or a Levis store, and invest an hour or more to find your next great Levis in the stack of unpredictability. Buying online is unlikely to get you that perfect pair.",4,"Don't buy online, try on several in a store."

The one's that I have boughten that were made outside the U.S.A., are like stretch pant's.  After I've had them on for a couple hours, the waist is an inch or more larger than when I put them on, as well as the rest of the levi's.  I love my 501's, so am know wearing my old one's instead of my new one's because they fit so much better.  The old one's are at least 15 years old, most are older than that.  The other thing is they move their manufactoring out of the U.S.A., so they are less expensive to make, but the price has never gone down!!! Just the quality!!!",2,yuck

Every one has split in the crotch area after about 6-8 months. I used to get 4-5 years out of a pair and usually they only wore through in the knees. As other reviewers have stated, they seem cut shorter in the waist so that I have to pull them up every time I stand up. Also, the denim seems of much lighter weight material to which I attribute the splitting in the crotch area. 501's used to be made in the USA with very heavy weight denim but these are sewn in Honduras and feel like cheap copies of real Levis. Used to love the fit and wear of 501's but guess I am going to have to try and find a new brand of jeans. Makes me sad as these used to be a great American-made product.",2,Not like the old 501's

B000YXC2LI,,"I had read the reviews, and noticed how disappointed some buyers were with the type of material,  I bought these Levi's  for the reason that they weren't the ""RIGID"" type.  I wanted exactly what I received.  The cotton material is not a thick denim material, as with the Rigid type of Levi's.  The color is a very dark black. If you are looking for the thick denim material Levi's you need to buy the Rigid type denim,  the description clearly states 100 Percent ""cotton"" material. (fairly thick)  Overall , I'm very pleased with this product.",5,"Great dark black color, very nice cotton material"
B000YXC2LI,,"While the jeans I got fit well and were comfortable, I was disappointed that the material was so thin.  i have some older 501's that are still hanging in there because the material was thicker and more substantial.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've heard the fit of these jeans resulted from Levi Strauss cutting the bottoms off a pair of overalls. I believe it, since the waist goes basically straight up from the butt.

I'll stick to the ""relaxed fit"" in the future, which fit me better.",3,"heavy, durable fabric. waist puckers under my belt"

The black one fitted perfectly on waist and on legs, but the m-stonewash was just wider in waist and short on legs... I had to do some stitching work on them in order to make them fit as the black one, for the short problem I had to live with that ;). What I want to express is that it was a failure of their Quality Control, they should be exactly the same, but they are not.

PD: One more difference was that the black one was also ""waterless"" made. At least it is what was written on the cartoon label.",4,Great jeans 1 CON only :( QC

He asked me to buy a pair of Levi's 501 as a present for his brother (size is W33L32, in ""Rinse"" color). The pair of Levi's 501 from Amazon was made in Egypt. This pair is really worse than all pairs of Levi's 501 we have bought before (their were made mostly in Turkey).

I don't want to say ""It's a bad jeans"", but I'm not sure the regular price is OK for it (I bought cheaper). Fabric is good. Size is correct. Color is good.

The jeans fit perfectly and are without any defects - contrary to what I have been told from sales associates that work in Levi's stores here in the SF Bay Area as to why Amazon.com can sell Levi's under $50 and Levi's Retail Stores can't.

B000YXC2LI,,"Last year I received 2 pair of Levis made in Haiti, I did not get them from Amazon.
Thet were so terribly constructed that I thought they were knock-offs. Any way the stitching in the rear end ripped 8 or 10 inches. There was also an issue with the room around the buttons on the fly, they did not give sufficient room to manipulate them. I threw them in the trash, a $100 loss. I have been wearing Levis for 50 years and never have seen such poor quality.

This year I bought 2 new pairs from Amazon and the were also made in Haiti. The have the same button issue, have loose thread ends everywhere, and the thread is different colors in different areas. I am going to give them a try, but will always be paranoid that the rear end will rip out. Never had to worry ever before!!!

The bottom line is that I am going to have to go the mall to purchase any more jeans, maybe they will be Wranglers

PS I contacted Levis and all they did was send corporate stamped out replys to me and said they could no guarantee that if they replaced them they would not be Hatian made. DO NOT ACCEPT LEVIS MADE IN HAITI",1,Haitian Levis are terrible
B000YXC2LI,,"It has been 15 years or so since I have purchased new jeans.  They were just not in my wardrobe and my old one got me through the odd occasion I needed them.  I had tried on numerous brands, sizes etc and came back to these every time.  For me, they fit just right, sit where I like them to and are comfortable out of the package.  If my past experience with these holds I will buy a couple more pair and then be done again for a decade or so.",4,Just like it used to be
B000YXC2LI,,"Heads up on the fit (regular, original, etc) descriptions. Unclear why Levi's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles (501, 505) but they did. What you used to buy is not what you're getting. Couldn't find a notice or explanation on any Levi's site, so you're on your own.",2,Watch out
B000YXC2LI,,"This will be the last pair of Levi's I purchase. Just to give some frame of reference for the 1 star, I'll go over a few things which have led me to abandon the brand all together. This is the third pair of Levi's I've purchased new in the last year and a half. The first two pairs have worn out beyond wearable use in less than a year and have ended up in the trash bin. I have no assurance that these will last longer than that either.

The fit and style of these are strange. They fit me around the waist but around the thighs and crotch they are much too small around my thighs. The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.

As a comparison of how terrible the quality of Levi's have become over the last few years, I had a pair of Levi's 501 that I purchased at age 16. They were beater jeans, worn in regular rotation until I lost them during a move a couple of years ago. Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.
These won't last more than a year and the fit is just uncomfortable and awkward.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the last time I will ever purchase Levi's jeans. They no longer have my trust.",1,Goodbye Levi's.
B000YXC2LI,,"I started wearing 501's over 40 years ago, loved them then, and love them even more now.  With all the jeans available and changing styles, 501's are a classic and the only jeans you'll ever need.",5,Old stand-by

B000YXC2LI,,THESE ARE NOT REAL LEVIS.  THEY ARE MADE IN EGYPT AND DO NOT FIT PROPERLY.  THE MATERIAL IS NOT THE SAME AS THE MATERIAL YOU BUY IN STORES.  DONT BE FOOLED.,1,They are NOT real Levi's
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"It used to be Levi 501s could be trusted for their quality, but Levi 501s sold today vary in where they are made, in how they are cut, and in the material used. In limited sampling, it seems the ones made in Mexico are truest to the original Levi 501 cut and denim. (I'm concerned only with the medium stonewashed style here). The jeans made in Egypt and Haiti differ in the material and sometimes in the cut--the cut can be quite bad--big in the seat or high on the waist. The original Original 501s were fantastic and relatively uniform in cut with nice soft denim. Today, the Mexican-made 501s are nearly as good as the original Original but even subtle differences appear here, such as one leg being slightly longer than the other. The Egyptian and Haitian are simply not good--the material is not soft and the cut is typically off the mark. And buying over the Internet, it's a crapshoot as to which ones you'll receive. Your best bet is to buy in a brick-and-mortar store, where you can look (and try on) before buying.",2,End of the 501 era
B000YXC2LI,,"After all the reviews I read, and the ones my friends told me, I am confused. These 501 shrink to fit jeans shrunk about one inch in the waist, and about an inch and a half in length exactly as advertised and exactly as the first ones I got in the first grade in 1962. These jeans are not as tough as they used to be but neither am I. They will last for me just fine. I can not beat Amazon's price around here unless they are on sale, and not everyone's sale. I ordered them on the ninth and they arrived on the eighteenth. I guess I am spoiled by Amazon because I usually get my stuff faster than that. I guess all in all the whole deal was as good as it always is. The jeans fit perfectly when I got them and after the wash they were a little tight, but after I wear them some they will stretch back to perfect, same as always. The last Levis I ordered came from Mexico, these came from Haiti and there was no difference in the quality at all. I will order them again.",4,Still good jeans

I then tried on an old pair of 30 inch waist jeans and they were tight but I could button them.  So... I took a tape measure and measured them, they're less than 30"".  I've read this situation has become a common problem with Levi's but it had never happened to me.  Since most of the stores I shop at now carry Lee's and since I can no longer trust Levi's sizing... I've bought my last pair of Levi's.",1,Levi's not what they used to be.
B000YXC2LI,,"I ordered two pairs of 501s via the Internet recently. I was shocked. One pair was so small I can't button them. Another was way oversized. Also got a pair of 514s and they were of such sheer fabric, I can't imagine them lasting more than a year, even with infrequent wearing.

I guess the message is to make the trek to the mall to buy Levi's. There, you can try on 40 pairs to find one that's right.

It's really disappointing.",1,Really awful

I have a grey color, dark blue, and a light blue pair of these same pants. They all fit different. Does Levi's have a quality control department or not?

B000YXC2LI,29.0,I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I ordered 501 original fit in medium stonewash.  In fewer than six months, the crotch material had come out.  I could no longer wear them and returned them minus a stocking fee of about $8.

The good part is Amazon's ability to take back a failure such as this.  I grew up in 501s and have always found them to be comfortable and tough.  Now, they're just comfortable.

The seams did not come apart.  It was the fabric.  Originally, fabric was so thick that they were hard to wear before being washed.  Even after washing, I could stretch the pants vertically and hold them from the bottom.  The fabric was that heavy.  Now, it's like gauze in comparison.

I'm going to try once more and hope for the best.

For over $40 I expected to get the same quality jeans I remembered.  The denim while quite heavy is not the same,  The buttons are not the same.  The inside seams on the legs are not the same.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've (intentionally) lost a bunch of weight in the last couple years and found myself going back to old pairs of jeans in my closet. Mostly Levi's 501's, some going back to the late 80's. Eventually I got to the point I needed a waist size < 31 inches and needed to buy new jeans since, sadly, I had given away my really OLD jeans from the 70's thinking I would never wear them again (advice -- NEVER throw away or give up your old Levi's, no matter how beat up they are). So I bought a pair of the hard to find 29X34's online here (made in Mexico). Fit is GREAT. Build quality is good. The material -- not as heavy as the material I remember from the 70's or even the pairs from the 80's I still have. I expect they will hold up okay though. For the price, I think they should go back to the heavier material. I mean, $50.00 for a pair of jeans is a significant investment. I may go back to wearing Wranglers again for this reason as they are HALF the cost of Levi's and fit/look just as good. I do really like the Levi's brand though and may order a second pair via Amazon (since 29X34 is so difficult to find in the stores).",4,"great fit, material not as good as I remember from the 70's"

Well, I was curious after these many years what had become of Levis - this once iconic American brand. I ordered a pair of 501s only to find what I had anticipated: build quality was crap (the stitching looks like third graders did it with a knitting needle (actually, that's probably not far from the truth)), material was thin and reminded me of the cheapos that typically end up on clearance racks), the fit after one wash was absurd.

B000YXC2LI,40.0,"As with most of the world, I looked at Levi's as synonomous with ""blue jeans"" or ""jeans"".  For me, they were always blue, always ""rigid"" and always ""right"".  I did not have to worry whether the material on the 501 was heavy duty, it always was.  I didn't have to know that a 501 is ""classic fit"" (which I purchase) verus ""straight"" (which falls off my swelling belly.  Now, however, I need to figure out what jeans fit, what color ""snap pop"" or ""clean fume"" is.  Does the Levi Strauss company have a marketing/market research department?  If so, I suggest firing them, hiring back your old advertising agency, make your jeans (yes, re-install the meaning behind the word ""jeans"")the same, dependable way they were classically made.  Remember the lessons learned with ""new Coke"", messing with an icon isn't wise.

Otherwise, split off a Levi Strauss Classic and just make 501 jeans in the US by traditional, classic standards.

Consistency is lost more or less, except with the 501's. The 501 style at least is going to fit the same way each time,no matter if they are made in Egypt or Mexico, Brazil or wherever they originate from. I always bought my jeans at Sears, but when you buy Levi 501's and see Egypt on the tags, well there's outsourcing and then there is outsourcing. Unbelievable, but get used to it. Its here to stay.

I have 3 other pair of 501's in the house that are the same size I ordered. These are pretty big. The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger.  So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.

Now the comment about going to Penny's. The last pair I bought there (501's are the only thing I buy there) seemed to be heavier material. Washed 501's seem to have a lot of size variance, so trying them on is good. Second, the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash.  These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings.  Almost looks dirty.

B000YXC2LI,,"Last year I got a new pair of 501's here at Amazon. After 13 months (worn maybe once a week), they ripped at the crotch. Conveniently, this was just past the replacement deadline.

What kind of 501's rip? I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. I was on my knees, painting a baseboard, went to move a foot or two down the wall and ""RRRRIP"", two inch tear in the crotch. I needed to get the work done, so I kept going. Within a half hour the tear was about 8 inches long starting from the bottom of the fly to half way down my thigh.

BUT. I give 4 stars instead of 2 because they discontinued the version I had, ""Quartz Stone"" color, which was a much thinner fabric than other 501's I've bought in years past. That's the trouble with ordering online, even Levi will sell you junk sometimes and you don't know until it's at your doorstep. As a matter of fact, I went to Kohls a few days ago and got a new pair of 501's, with much sturdier feeling denim this time. The fabric color is either Dark Stonewash or Rinse, I'm not totally sure.

My new ones are as follows: unpolished rivets that are half-finished brass (look like brass on the inside, steel on the outside) and say ""L.S. & Co. - S.F."". There are 5 steel fly buttons (4 medium, 1 big) that have a mild patina and say ""Levi Strauss & Co. S.F. Cal"". Bronze stitching, traditional ""certificate"" printed on inside pocket, as well as the usual brown trademark stitched on the back, though they changed the stamped style/size to printed (not as cool in my opinion, but nobody will ever notice). Size is 34x30, actual is 34.75x29.75. Fit is perfect, not too baggy not too hipster (straight leg).

We'll see if the new ones rip in a year. Fingers crossed they don't.",4,They ripped!

I am talking about the original non shrink to fit ones. the pants I ordered are very different in material and sizing as pants I bought last year, which I really liked, the sizing on new pants seems to be odd, slightly shorter leg length and smaller waist size from my last year 501's and other brands of pants. I am a usually a 30x30, but I had to return the pants 2 times due to unsatisfied sizing, 1st I ordered 31x30 but those didn't work, next I ordered the 30x32 but these pants will come on Friday.

Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?

It's easy to question a product you get in the mail when there aren't shelves of the same item surrounding you to compare them with.  But 501s have a different feel than other styles of Levi jeans.  The same as with trying them on in the store two jeans of the exact style and size can have a slightly different fit.  Jeans have always been this way.  And wih some sites shopping on line can be a hassle but with Amazon it is very easy and user friendly.  They encourage returns if the jeans do not fit correctly.  So if you do experience that rare occurence where the same size fits differently (or perhaps you even put on a little weight) if tags are intact you can return them free no questions asked.

So here on Amazon I can get the high quality 501s that I love for no other jean fits me so comfortably with a low waist that gives me the perfect look I want.  And with Amazon and my needing the larger size I can shop till I get the ideal pair.  Highly recommend the awesome 501 jeans as well as the shopping experience on Amazon.",5,Excellent jeans at an excellent price

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"Two years ago I ordered 5 pairs of Levi's 501 jeans. These ""Shrink to Fit"" are great.
The issue I have is with Levi's product naming ccombined with Amazon's page design that obscures whether a ""color"" is ""Shrink to Fit"" or ""Standard Fit""

Using the link from my previous order I was sent to Amazon's generic Levis 501 page. Doing some research on the us. Levi web site, it appears that Levi makes 501 in both ""Shrink to Fit"" and ""Standard Fit"". The Amazon page that was linked to a previous order does not distinguish which ""color"" is ""Shrink to Fit"" and which color is ""Standard Fit"". This makes ordering the proper size very difficult.

Amazon has a ""Shrink to Fit page"" page, but in the generic ""Levi's 501"" page I cannot tell which _colors_ are ""Shrink to Fit"" and which are ""Standard Fit"". This attribute should be part of the ""Sizing"".

The product is good is you get the fit you expect. However, the combination of Levi's product naming, and Amazon putting ""Standard Fit"" on the same page as ""Shrink to Fit"" without disclosing which color is which fit, makes it problematic.",3,Levis Product Naming and Amazon Page Design Issues

I would much rather have paid a higher price and have them left things the way they were, but I guess they would not get the volume of sales to support such a concept.

Since 20 years I am wearing these products, especial the 501, but since they
are made in Pakistan the quality is worse then ever.

Last time I was in Germany at
Chemnitz in a Levis shop. The sold black pants were full of white yarn, now
I ordered a 501 in Hungary and I got one whit a textile weave error.
The reason I could not order at Amazon.com is, that there are restrictions
from Levis it self! You should know, that the product is more expensive in
Germany or Hungary then it is in the US!
The pants are costing between 70-90-s over here in Europe! I do not think
this is the right quality for that price!
Shame on the quality politic of these kind of producers!

However, the results were great; I really love 501's now. They fit me better than even the old style of 505's. The material feels stronger than the 505's.

However I have always chosen my work environment for its fashion taste in stone washed 501's. Do not tell anyone but I take mine to the cleaners and have them dry-cleaned and pressed (no starch), just crisp and casual at the same time; it is an old habit from my military days. Come to think of it the military used button fly's also.

 I can see the problem of purchasing online vs. store bought is that they use obscure words as ""rigid"" in place of gage (or oz.) Not one did they mention the tab color which is Levi's way of sorting the Mercedes quality version from their Yugo (lighter weight but still from Levi) version. And yes they are subject to globalization which in this day and age is a ""no no""; and there is no way to tell without looking at the label. Well enough of this negative stuff.

An advantage of on line is getting those obscure colors and exact size (saving a tad in tailoring). Also saving gasoline (sort of an expensive commodity now days) and time.

B000YXC2LI,17.0,"I've been wearing Levi's 501 since the early 80's and I have 8 pair of them from that time to around 1995 that are close to worn out by now (but soft, like pajamas almost). The quality of the denim between then and now is distinct.

For instance, I bought a pair 4 months ago (sadly, the last Levi's I'll ever buy) that ripped after getting caught on the corner of a desk. Any of the earlier pairs I have were put through much worse abuse (hunting in South Texas [thorny mesquite trees-dense brush], hiking/camping in New Mexico mountains, working in a truck repair shop) without any noticeable damage like a big rip.

The price has gone up even though they are clearly using lower quality denim. At ~$40 they're just not worth it. I never owned CK's or Jordache because Levi's looked just as good, were more durable and cost 50% less. Now, if I'm going to spend $40 for jeans, they might as well be CK's since those are clearly made of higher quality denim at least.

It's possible that the other ones just shrank more than these, but I've washed these in HOT water 2 or 3 times. They're not getting any smaller.

Aside from that, they are lightweight, comfortable, button-fly, and fade into a greyish charcoal-y look that I really like. When I sit they kind of push into my stomach uncomfortably unless I pull them up before sitting, and that's kind of annoying, but I don't know if that has more to do with my body shape or the way they are cut.

B000YXC2LI,560.0,"I have been wearing Levi 501 shrink-to-fit for at least 20 years.  My advice re. buying online is don't.  Here's why.

I hate to shop and normally just ask my wife to pick up some jeans when she's at the store.  I know my size, and this has always worked.  So, when internet shopping came into vogue, things were even easier.  Until a couple of years ago.  Starting then, my good old size started showing up too big, or too small, or wouldn't shrink right.  Bottom line is that I wound up with several unusable pairs of jeans.  So, I finally bit the bullet and made the trek to Macy's.  Tried on 4-5 pairs of identically marked jeans and they were all over the map.  Found a pair that fit.  Washed them once and they turned into floods.  Returned them and got another pair.  Washed them and they're ok.  So, I'm done with buying jeans online.  And I'm probably done with Levi's.

I say ""probably"" because this assumes I can find anything any better.  The market provides what the consumer demands, and apparently what the American consumer demands is cheap, useless junk.  As other reviewers have observed, the current version of Levi's denim is shameful.  Not only is it thin and non-wearing,  but since it shrinks along one bias more than the other, it is important to orient the fabric in the machine correctly.  Apparently, this is too much to ask.  Ditto for getting either the waist or the leg to match the label.

Bottom line:  My advice is, if you're going to buy Levi's, don't do it online.  It just doesn't work.",1,I wouldn't.....
B000YXC2LI,566.0,"I have been buying the sized 501's (not the Shrink-to=Fits) for my husband for nearly 15 years.  Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.

Until this week, I had been wearing levis all my life and in recent years was only wearing 501's for all occasions. I buy many different colors for my various activites. Currently I have over 10 pairs that have never been worn because there is no quality control at Levi Strauss. Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs. One last issue I have is that the material does not hold up. some of the 501's I bought in recent months rip after wearing them just a few times, some of the buttons come apart.",1,"Label says the same size, the fit says otherwise; ever thinning denim"
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I agree with some other negative reviews that this fabric is either lighter weight than the 501s are in the stores or it is lighter weight than they used to be (which is certainly the case). However, I'm not working in construction and I'm not sliding down dirt paths on my knees so I haven't seen this to be an issue. The fit is very comfortable, what I am familiar with from buying in the store.

The color ""Medium Iconic"" is nice and similar to what I would consider a regular unadorned denim color. It has a slight lined pattern which you can see in the extreme closeup of the product image. However I would say there is a slight differrence that is not discernable in the product image. In real life, the line pattern appears to be more vertical than side to side. Also, there is a slight faded wear pattern on the front of the thighs so that it appears slightly lighter there, but it's not so pronounced as to be ridiculously false and trendy for the sake of it. I do think the subtle lined pattern adds some style to the jeans, but like I said about the fading, it's not so dramatic as to scream ""Hey! Notice my fancy jeans!""

If you're going to be subjecting these jeans to heavy wear, then maybe don't get these, and instead go buy some Dickies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dickies-Men-s-Relaxed-Fit-Double-Knee-Work-Horse-Jean/dp/B000N8Q5IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dickies Men's Relaxed Fit Double Knee Work Horse Jean</a>).

Though finding that perfect pair of men's jeans is never easy. Delivery was fast and I was surprised how dark they are (more than pictures show). Actually good design makes it acceptable even to our company dress code so I wear them whenever I can. I am very comfortable with a great fit.

Worn out in this case are small holes so the jeans are able to be recycled for work on the farm. Again, comfort is a premium. Should you wear Levi's 501's? It's all a matter of taste. I have it, and I must say that when I used to do office work, my bosses didn't. I had to work overtime to gain Casual Day Certificates to wear 501's. Really, it was worth it. Did I say this yet?

The Amazon web page that came up advertised Levi's 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the size, and I proceeded to select a pair.  The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit.  I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised.  The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.  However, the online resolution screen haughtily claimed that since the purchasing error was my fault, Amazon would not pay for the shipping.  There are too many unknowns in fit when purchasing clothes from potentially erroneous web sites for me to repeat this exercise.",1,Amazon didn't take responsibility for incorrect web page

B000YXC2LI,12.0,"Although advertised as pre-shrunk, these continue to shrink drastically, and the wrinkles are hideous.  Got two different colors, same results.  Ordered the 517's as well, and they stayed true to fit without the wrinkles.",1,Other Levi choices are better
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I normally don't do reviews, but this time I have something helpful to say so I thought I'd share it.  The Verde Rigid is actually a Shrink to Fit jean and is not ""Pre Shrunk"" like it says here on Amazon. I bought my normal size, 30x30, washed it gentle cycle in cold water and dried in low heat. It came out super shrunk!!

Then I looked online and found this:

Made with rigid denim that you wash to a perfect fit and finish. Keep it dark and clean by washing as little as possible, or fade it with gentle washing. Will shrink approximately 10 percent; size up 1"" if waist is between 27""- 36"", size up 2"" if waist is between 38""- 48"". Increase length by 3"".

But since I am really a 30x30 and they don't make 31x33, I debated whether I should go 31x32 or 31x34. They also said somewhere if you wear boots, add an extra inch, so it would be 31x34. I don't wear boots and I wear these jeans when I ride my bike, so I decided to get 31x32. I hope they turn out cool.

Oh also, I called Amazon, and they were totally cool with it and issued me a full refund although I washed the jeans and it shrunk like crazy. They need to move this to the Shrink to Fit section.

Also, even though these jeans shrunk like crazy, they still kinda fit although they are kinda short in the inseam. They fit kinda tight, but the quality is great! They are super rigid and durable, I've never had a pair of jeans like this! I read somewhere that when you get your jeans, you should shrink them by taking off the tags, putting them on, and getting into a bathtub full of hot/cold water (depending on color of jeans and extent of fade you want). You sit there for about 30 minutes and when you get out, the water should be all blue and you will have a custom fitting jean! I will try that on my next pair instead of throwing them into the washer and dryer. Because I left them in the dryer for 2 days, they came out super wrinkly and they stay that way!! It's better for them to conform to your legs than all your other clothes in your dryer!",5,"5 Star Quality, but these are Shrink to Fit!! (Verde Rigid)"
B000YXC2LI,5.0,"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

It finally occurred to me to try the obvious, and check out the men's department instead. I'm overjoyed to discover that men's standard Levi's 501s fit me just fine, and look the way I expect jeans to look. They have pockets, and belt loops big enough to fit a normal belt, and legs that reach all the way down to my shoes. Hooray.",5,The quintessence of pants

I even had a pair that I purchased directly from levis.com a few months ago that the loop ripped out of and when I went to repair it I found that it and one other loop had already been repaired once (I didn't notice the patches while I was wearing them, who looks inside there?). They must not have passed QC at the factory and were ""fixed"" before being sent out. Just last night I took off one of my new, less than a month old pairs and found a belt loop hanging off and the tell-tale hole. No more.

B000YXC2LI,,"The 501 shrink-to-fit, button-fly jeans have undergone some radical changes. The pocket socks are shallower and the material thinner. The denim is not as heavy, and the once durable stitching is now a hit and miss operation. The structure of the 501 has changed. Gone are the engineered (7) traditional belt loops, which now number only (5). Only one back-centered belt loop exists now, leaving an 8-inch span between the belt loops on either side. Note pic. The black Levis are from 1997, and the blue Levis are from 2018.

postscript: The black 1997 Levi's (w/ black stitching mind you, not the ""Filipino"" orange/gold stitching of today's versions) are 33 x 36 and fit perfectly. I just ordered a 501, shrink-to-fit Rigid Blue pair in 34 x34, and as expected, Levi changed their sizing, so if you want them to fit, then order one size larger than normal in the waist, and the next size shorter in length than you would usually order in a 501. They're a little baggie in the seat now, but far from the ""marble bagger's"" of their size 33 waist offered today. So, waist size up, and length-down and you might be happy. Levi's still are missing the two back belt loops, so cut some off of an old pair and have them sewn-on like I did. Boy Howdy. Hoop jumping to buy Levi's. Sad.",3,SAD

B000YXC2LI,15.0,"This is basically about overall quality.  Over the years I have watched the quality decline in every aspect.

Inconsistent workmanship.  One used to be able to count on one pair of jeans being the same as previous pairs.  Not the case anymore.  In my last three orders of multiple pairs of 501s, items in the same order were inconsistent.

The fabric gets thinner every year.

Right rear pocket attachment point develops a hole over a short period of time.  I do not carry anything in that pocket.

A pair of Levi's would last years.  Six months is considered amazing with today's product.

These are made in more countries that I can begin to count with some of the worst quality control and workmanship that I could document using ISO9000 standards.

Bottom line.  Overpriced junk.  This is the last time I will deal with this company who was based on quality in the past but has lost their commitment to the primary factor that made them great.  Time to try Wrangler once again next go around.  Ordered them in the past and went back to Levi's after the thinner material seemed cheap.  This latest Levi order makes Wrangler look more attractive with the latest, additional decline, in Levi quality.",1,After over six decades of being a Levi's fan it's time to call it quits

Levi's has myriad different levels of quality, now. 501's are *not* what they were when one could only buy the ""raw"" cloth type, and had to wash 'em five times before they were comfortable. Levis, especially 501s, are best purchased in a brick-and-mortar store, preferably a high-quality one, than they are on-line. We've found some great buys at stores where we could examine the merchandise.

Late to the party with this review. The pair I bought from Amazon has recently worn out; as a hole appeared in a rather compromising (crotch) part of the pants. Not like the Levi's I know and love...

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"UPDATE - Yeah these are garbage.  They are Levi's in name only and don't carry the quality you'd expect.  These are going back and my hunt to find a reputable denim company to replace my 505s continues!!  I'm only rating 1 star so i can leave a review.  Otherwise they should pay me for the time I've taken out of my day to review their garbage.

I'm not impressed at all with these 501s.  Normally I wear 505s and when I say normally I mean I have 1 good pair of jeans that i wear regularly, they are old, they are ""broken in"" and they are Levi's 505s.  I've lost some weight recently so i decided to purchase a new pair of Levi's and went with the classic 501s.  Wow the quality seems to have really taken a dive.

These Jeans are stiff.  No, not like new jean stiff.  I'm talking I could stand them up on their own without any support.  While unfolding them I joking thought to myself ""these jeans are so stiff they might crack!"".  Stiffness aside, the jean material feels much cheaper than my previous pair which have been worn hundreds of times and is still a much better quality than these brand new 501s.

I've washed them twice in a effort to get off the extra die and to try and loosen them up.  They still feel crunchy and stuff.  I'm going to wear them around a couple hours to see if them relax and break-in at all.  If not, these are heading back.",1,Skip Levi's and go with another brand ... the quality is really down the tubes

B000YXC2LI,,"I've been wearing Levi's since I could fit into them. They were the jeans back when I was a kid. I was so sick of Sears Toughskins because they had the reinforced knees that looked like somebody had stuffed a piece of cardboard in there. They screamed ""Your Mom is Practical!"" Levi's, on the other hand, were cool. It was what the hippies and fishermen wore. I'm talking about the early 1970s in Alaska. I grew up in that alternative lifestyle, one where if you wore a sport jacket, it was used. And you wore a paisley shirt, maybe some work boots. You rolled your own cigarettes and the other stuff, too. So anyway, I'm a fan. I remember wearing Levi's to work everyday as a reporter at the Anchorage Times, may that great paper rest in peace. And I still wear them, except now I work for a rural weekly waiting for technology and the economy to send all us old reporters out to pasture. Of course, I also wear slacks, LL Bean khakis. But the Levi fit is second to none. I tried Lee again but was dissatisfied. Higher waisted. Baggier. I had some Lees that rocked back in fourth grade but got battery acid all over them and they disintegrated. Batteries die at 30 below zero and you have to muscle them inside to warm and charge. I wore the same size 501s for years. I'd wash them several times so they'd soften. But now I'm old and wider. I wear 36 waist and 34 inseam. I wear a belt.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I've worn these all my life, almost 70 years, but the quality has dropped a lot over the years even more so lately and of course the price went up, $10 more than my last pair cost here. Levi is spinning in is grave at the shameful quality of these, For years, decades, several generations,  a new pair had to be broke in, you beat them with sticks and rocks dragged them through mud puddles, just to loose up the fibers so the legs would even bend at the knees  These are like tissue paper in comparison. And last about as long if you still work hard for your living, But now that industrial hemp is again allowed to be grown the Original Version could be brought back. But if they do Mark My Words the price will more than double, not because they will cost more to make Because they will last 5 times or more longer. Until then we are getting ripped off with an inferior over priced product. And made in China, or anywhere but the USA,  is a real huge insult to Levi Strauss and the American Worker Levi made them for. So Sad",3,just to loose up the fibers so the legs would even bend at the knees These are like tissue paper in comparison

All my other pairs fit fine so it is not the post Thanksgiving swelling. I will never buy Levis online again. If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear. I wouldn't expect them to last more than a few months of washing because of how thin they are made. I am wholeheartedly saddened if this is the quality that Levis has sunken  to.

Recently I decided to splurge and get a pair of Levi's. They looked great and fit great. Since they were my ""fancy"" jeans, I did not wear them for yard work or anything, just two days sitting at a desk and one wash every week.

Imagine my surprise when, after six weeks, the belt loop failed! About two weeks after the return window closed.

I suppose I will figure out some way to patch them, but they sure aren't my ""fancy"" jeans any longer.

I thought I could buy more expensive (assuming higher quality) stuff and buy and discard it less often, have better stuff and help the environment a little. However, in the case of jeans, it looks like I need to buy the cheapest acceptable product and replace it frequently, treating it more like a consumable, Oh well, Wrangler, here I come...",2,Others have something like a belt loop failure after 6-12 months

These jeans always fit me great but never last a year until the crotch splits out on them. I've had them in various sizes over the years and love them. For $40-50 they're worth it. I went to a local retailer to buy them like I always do and they wanted $70!! I passed and just ordered from Amazon. One thing to note, the length seems to run short.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've been wearing Levi's jeans for 30 years. The last time I bought a few pairs online the fit was off (too tight in some areas, loose in others). I though it was just a fluke. However, when I received the most recent pair, I found more quality issues. In this case the back pockets were sewn on so low that they are on the leg of the pants! The 501 jeans are supposed to be low rise but these reach much higher.

Apparently the Levi company closed their US production plants and now manufactures their jeans in Asia and Mexico. The result seems to be slipping quality control. The pair I received were produced in Mexico, however other reviewers have had similar complaints about jeans made in Asia. I highly recommend buying these in a store where they can be checked for quality and fit. For at least the first 20 years of buying these, I simply grabbed them off the shelf in my size and never had to worry about trying them on. I knew they were what I had been buying all along. Unfortunately those days seem to be over when it comes to buying Levi's jeans, at least online.",3,"Levi, what happened to you?"

I had bought Levi's before here on amazon, on the big famous auction site and on different brick and mortar stores around the world and I had never seen a pair like these.

I wish I could return them, but I had them forwarded from the USA to my country and sending them back would cost more than buying them again. An absolute waste of money :-(

I attach photos to compare this 40/30 to a rarely used 36/30 made in Mxico (same size!) and a 38/30 also made in Mxico but with a bit more use (the Amazon-purchased 40 looks like 4 sizes smaller than the 38!!!)",1,Made in Egypt.... for aliens or something.

B000YXC2LI,,"Ok I didn't even know they still made Levi 501's! Let me begin at the start. I was diagnosed with advanced stage IV cancer and I was told to fatten up as much as humanly possible or risk dying from the very aggressive daily regimens of radioactive & chemotherapy which would eventually cause me to despise food to the point of not eating a thing for 2 1/2 months! My lead oncologists team of physicians all pleaded with me to begin eating anything or suffer having tubes surgically implanted into my stomach for nutrition. So cut to now, I survived my therapy but not without coming way too close to death due to lack of nutrition as well as the lack of use of my digestive system. Now I seem to be able to eat whatever, whenever and I still can't keep the weight on. This has been both a curse and a blessing. The curse is of course for obvious reasons but the benefits have been wearing clothes that I never thought I'd be able to pull off let alone put on ever again! I'm wearing sizes that my body hasn't seen or felt in 25years. My wife and I have an inside joke that keeps the seriousness of what we've been going through together due to cancer and it centers around the fact that although I'm far from being out of the woods due to this deadly killer, I'm not looking like one would think after gaining all that extra weight, almost dying three times, having visible signs of radiation burns on the exterior of my skin and then losing all the weight. I'm not being conceited but I look like I did at 24years old and am wearing the same sized clothing, especially in the area of my waist, so buying new pants and having them fit comfortably as well as look great is definitely an ego boost! So the joke is, I'm the poster boy for cancer because it agrees with me lol anyway thank you for reading this far into my rant as it's turned out rather than a review. The Levis 501's feel great! They fit as perfectly as they did when I wore them for the first time back in the 80's Dont pass up a chance to get a great pair of jeans to show off that great pair of genes you've been blessed with!",5,"Fits like an old glove!

B000YXC2LI,,"I'm sure I'm old school. For instance, I value my time. I imagine a lot of people do. Which is why they invented zippers. Zippers really are incredibly handy. Imagine you've got to catch a bus in just a few moments. Then nature calls. Well, it's a quick matter to take care of things and get out there to the bus.

But, the new graduates of (Fill in the Name of Your Favorite Prestigious Business School) have decided that they have a better idea. Don't they always? Replace the zipper with not three, not four, but five separate buttons to close the fly. This does not include the button where the belt comes together (which, assuming the Prestigious Business School taught them had to use both hands to add) comes to a total of six. Of course, you don't really need to undo the topmost button to take care of business. But, the whole arrangement of the buttons being fastened into an inner last just complicates things. It really is a pain in the fly.

And, really, why? The cute (I'll give them that) buttons aren't visible, so are meaningless. They aren't particularly easy to fasten (if easy at all). As William Shakespeare said when he tried these on: Much ado about nothing.

I agree with the reviews of many others. These are the last Levi's I buy. Stick with what works. There's a reason flies have zippers. Even if prestigious Business School Graduates think they don't.",1,A pain in the fly... Note to self: Always read the fine print (and other reviews).

Call me old fashioned but this guy doesn't have the time it would take to open and close that button opening each time he needs to void. I have no idea what was in the head of whoever designed and thought a guy wants a button fly with the classic metal buttons and the slightly too small holes. I'm left to wonder, has there been a lot of complaints from men about the metal zipper? Do a lot of guys enjoy wrestling with the five classic metal buttons and the reinforced holes that are too small? Lesson learned. This was first and last time I buy Jeans online without taking the extra time to investigate the fly opening.

Then they offered the preshrunk version which was more user friendly. 501's used to last many years ... I always had several pair and they all fit the same. The current version is junk! Don't waste your money! They don't fit properly anymore and they are poorly made! The last two pair I bought were too big in the waste and butt and too tight in the thigh area. Actually, that was only for one pair, the other pair had distinctly different issues. I wish I could say I've slimmed down in the waste and bulked up my thighs but I'd be lying if I did! Like everyone else's reviews, the belt loops mysteriously unattach themselves and the rear pocket corners rip open. I can only assume that the 10 year old working in the sweatshop in Jakarta couldn't afford breakfast when he began his 12 hour day at the sewing machine!

Now, the new pair that I received recently: the fabric feels thicker. Not as good as it was in 1980ies, but as good as it gets these days. There's new stitch around the fly (see the pic). The big disappointment is the fact they changed buttons' supplier. Buttons are lighter and thinner now (see the pic). I like the buttons on my old 501. That's why I wanted to give 3 stars, but the fabric is quite thick, feels thicker then the one I had with previous pair. Result - 4 stars. Leg length is as expected.

B000YXC2LI,6.0,"When I was young, a long time ago, THE JEANS  to wear were Levi's 501. For whatever reasons, I moved away from 501's to designer jeans. They never fit as well, looked as good on and certainly cost a lot more. Well as I have aged, I have gotten smarter . I went back to try 501's. It took several trys to get the right size. But I didn't give up. The Levi's 501 are the best fitting jeans ever made. I didn't get the original shrink to fit. I did get the preshrunk ready to go. The fit is just as great as they were when I wore them in my teens. The fit is flattering, soooo comfortable, and perfect. They don't look like old lady jeans or jeans that are about to fall off. The waist is where it should be for jeans. The cut of the leg is great and the leg is great for boots, heels, sandles, or tennis shoes.  Yes, I am an older lady  (60+), but I still love my jeans and don't want to look like an old lady or a teenager. I am not wasting my money on any other jeans. I am sticking with button fly 501's . The perfect levi!!!",5,Perfect Levi.

B000YXC2LI,,"Ordered two pairs of Levi's 501 original fit from Amazon, less than one month apart. While the sizing seems consistent, the second pair, made in Egypt, is definitely made from lighter-weight denim than the first, which was made in Mexico. The weights are 678 g and 725 g, a difference of 47 g, or about 1.7 oz. If a pair takes about 1.5 yards of fabric to make (32w x 30l) this means that the Egyptian denim has a weight of about 1 oz per yard less than the Mexican. This is reflected in an immediately noticeable difference in ""feel"" -- the Egyptian pair has a softer hand; the Mexican pair seems sturdier and more canvas-like. A couple of stitching details also seem more careless on the Egyptian, although there are enough authentic features so that I don't suspect a counterfeit -- maybe it's just sloppy quality control? In any event I'm reluctant to order more, since there is no way to specify country of origin and it's not possible to be sure what I'm going to get. The Mexican pair is solid and great, taking off one star for lack of manufacturing consistency.",4,"Nice, solid jeans, but some inconsistency depending on country where manufactured."

Way too long (like at least 2""), ridiculous amount of space in the seat compared to real 501's, and the leg was bordering on baggy.

If you've not purchased 501's for several years, think carefully about buying these because either Levi's or the manufacturer (NOT MADE IN AMERICA!! NOT MADE IN AMERICA!! NOT MADE IN AMERICA!!) have majorly broken them.

I went to the Levi's store to look for jeans that fit (and weren't ""dad"" jeans) and the young ladies said to try these.  I used to wear 501's when I was younger and was leary.  However they said these ""original fit"" (not original shrink to fit) don't shrink much and should work out.  They were right, these non-shrink to fit 501s are very comfortable.  I wash them cold, usually hang dry (although I have dried them a couple times, so I know that they don't shrink much).  I also use the Woolite Dark detergent which helps to keep the dark blue darker (which for this pair is what I wanted). Definitely not ""dad"" jeans.  The button fly is a bit of a pain, but you get used to it (just as I did back in the ""old"" days). I have both the dark blue and a khaki colored pairs.  Note these are definitely not work jeans they are a lighter denim (although the khaki seem a bit heavier) and to me are more of a casual wear/fashion jean.  I think that is why a lot of people post negative reviews about them.  Not every pair of jeans is designed for hard work environments.  When I am doing that, I wear my Carhartt canvas work pants.

B000YXC2LI,24.0,"Have been wearing Levi's for years. They fit as usual. I enjoyed them because I always knew what size to order, and I thought I enjoyed the fit. However, recently Levi's have been poorly made. The material is thin and doesn't hold up. I also have found that the crotch area tends to pinch my tender spots when I sit down. After spending $50 for a pair or jeans and having them get torn in the crotch area after a week or working, I have since changed to Wrangler. I have found the 47 fit to be similar to Levi's, yet much stronger, and i don't experience the crotch pinch and tear like I do with my old 501's. I will say that I keep one new pair of 501's in the closet for my going out jeans. The color of 501's is hard to match in other brands, so  when I need a more fancy pair to wear out, I still go to my one pair of 501's. If you work in your jeans, I would recommend trying a pair of Wrangler 47's for a more durable and half the cost pair of jeans.",2,Levi's have lost me as a customer

B000YXC2LI,,"Started buying 501's in 2011 when I started college, but I wore strictly Levi's growing up. I still have three old pairs of 501's from that time. Two prewashed and one pair of shrink to fits. The fit on all of them is similar, but the ones I worked outdoors in and washed and dried more had a slimer fit in the legs. I spent a year & a half in the shrink to fits but overall: they are alittle less comfortable and less flattering. Of all of them, the last pair I purchased, ablack pre washed with dark gray rivets and regular patch, a combination they no longer make I think, are the only ones I still use, now that I can fit into them again. For a while I switched to Wrangler 13wmz's after I gained some weight. I wanted to buy some new 501s since I've been getting alota use out of those old ones. I went to a local Levi's retailer to try some on to determine just was size I should buy online. I'm glad I did because I found that 501s are not what they used to be. Now, I've heard from my dad, my old boss, and other loyal Levi's customers that Levi's used to be made with a more stiff, durable denim fabric, and from the vintage Levi's I've collected and seen, I can say that's the truth. But as long as I have buying them new for myself, they've been kinda lightweight (Good for the weather here in Texas), with a distinct smoothness after significant wear, and still pretty durable. Today, the fabric feels completely different, although I can't speak to its durability. My biggest complaint is with the fit. Pictures of the aforementioned folks during the 70's & 80's show a jean that looks similar to the jeans I used buy. I can't really say that's still true. These new 501's don't have the roomy seat that I associate with the cut, they sit lower on the waist, and the pewter riveted buttons on the fly and waist are smaller and more delicate than they used to be. The crotch it's more comfortable now, sure, but I liked the snug, old school, cowboy look that they used to have. They basically fit like a slightly relaxes skinny jean now, and personally, I think skinny jeans look absurd with western boots, on both men and women, and that's usually what I wear. I have always loved Levi's, and think that the old 501 cut will always have a nostalgia and elegance in design that other jeans just don't have, but they have lost my business with these recent changes.",2,they are alittle less comfortable and less flattering
B000YXC2LI,,"thought I was getting the original heavy fabric, it is thin.",3,Three Stars
B000YXC2LI,3.0,"I've worn 501s most of my life.  I just love the button fly.  Plus they give me a butt where other brands don't.  But Levi's are getting so much harder to find anymore.  Around here, Wranglers reign supreme.  I'd lost enough weight that the size 32s had beco,e rather baggy for me to wear.  I saw these on Amazon and the price was great.  They normally sell for $79 at Penny's or Macy's.  Plus, the size that I need are even more difficult to find.  I guess it's the proof you'd need to see that America has gotten fatter.  The 32"" inseam is just too short.  Even the 34"" inseam is kinda short than I like.  So how difficult is it to find size 29"" waist with 36"" inseam?  Very difficult it turns out.  Apparently Levi doesn't make a 29""/36"" jean anymore.

So I ordered a size 29"" waist with 34"" inseam.  They fit great, though the length I fear is gonna come up a tad short.  Fearing this, I also ordered a size 30"" waist with 36"" inseam.  They are a tad baggy.  The length was perfect though.  So frustrating.  I'm gonna keep them just in case I do gain a bit of weight though.  I'll just have to be happy with the 34"" inseam for the 29"" waist.

On the jeans themselves.  It seems the denim they are using is a bit thinner than what they used to use.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Well, I have really tried to give Levi 501 a fair shake due to my loyalty to the company. They have always been my favorite jeans that fit the best and hold up over time. Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!! I will be donating to Good Will because I refuse to wear and advertise or promote your product. If I were Amazon I would refuse to sell this product as advertised.

I suppose I might be gaining weight, but older pairs (again, in the exact same size) fit beautifully and I will occasionally wash them to shrink them back to size.  This pair is finally broken in enough to be more or less comfortable, though still a touch snug.  I will probably size up next time, though, and explore other fits.

The challenge with Levi jeans is that you can buy 3 or 4 pair of the same style and size and there will be inconsistencies in the fit. That was my only hesitation in making this purchase. However, after receiving this pair I found they do fit as expected with one caveat - the right leg outside seam does not travel straight down from the hip to the cuff, so it hits the area of my right knee sort of wonky. Not worth sending back and I'm used to it now.",4,Fit as Expected - Finish could be better.

B000YXC2LI,,The jeans themselves are great. I chose the 501's due to the larger thigh. My son is a power lifter but his thighs are still too big for these. Levi's is a great brand they just don't work for very muscular men. The athletic fit ones are even smaller in the thigh area.,4,Great!

On a related note, I produce two or three pair per year that look exactly like the ones young people pay $100 and more for, with rips and wear holes in them.
Only mine get that way from actual work.
If anyone who reads this knows how I can market them, please post a note.  I'd be happy to sell them for what I pay for them new--a fraction of what similar ones bring.  34W, 32L.

B000YXC2LI,,"I remain a fan of 501's.  They always seem to fit better/feel more comfortable than other jeans and they hold up for a reasonably long time. The pair that I bought in Nov 2016 fits just as well as those I've bought in the past.  I'm also a repeat buyer of the tan ""Timberwolf"" color -- t goes really well with many different shirt colors, just as khakis do..  I do agree with those other reviewers who say that Levi's seems to be using thinner fabrics (probably to save money and, perhaps, to make them more appealing in market areas with warmer climates south of the border where 501's remain somewhat popular).  Even so, the lighter fabric does not wear out particularly fast in my experience.  Style-wise, 501's are not what most American guys are wearing anymore and many hate the button fly design, but I think they still look better than most jeans that are on the market.",5,"501's Good Fit, Classic Style"

I'm not arguing that they are as good as they used to be, I'm just saying they look to be manufactured reasonably well and are worth the $30 I paid for them.  If I were buying work jeans, I'd buy Carhart, but as casual wear, I think they'll last at least a year.  I remember paying $45-$60 for 501's back in the 90's.

One mentioned that the Tidal Blue was indeed the original fit, color, material, texture, etc of the ""old"" Levi's 501 jean.  WRONG.  I was very disappointed in paying a premium for these.  Material color was a white and navy dotted mix, the rivets are silver colored rather than original copper, but worst of all are the deep fake wrinkles that are molded into the crotch and thigh area.  That may be OK for the younger crowd, but for us old timers who grew up with the stiff, selvage denim 501s of the '60s it just isn't going to do.

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"You will not find American made Levis on Amazon! If you want genuine selvedged Levis, you have to go to the official Levi website.  They run around $60+

I ordered two pair of 38x34 from amazon. One made in Egypt, and one made in Mexico.  The legs on one pair were 2 inches longer than the other pair, and the material is thin compared to the jeans I expect from Levis.  The stitching is also single hem down the inseam, and the belt loops are chincy! I feel like I could tear them apart with my bare hands!

They will probably last a little while, but if you spend a little more on AMERICAN made products, your overall satisfaction will more than make up for the higher price paid.

On 10/20/16 the Levi website is running a deal where you get 20% off two items, or 30% off three items (jeans).  Look at the materials list for your particular jeans to make sure they were made in America, but if you spend less than $60, you can be sure they were produced in another country.

B000YXC2LI,,"These jeans have got it all: color, style, and fit. It's no wonder they are a classic. They give an extremely sleek definition to the legs while being very comfortable at the same time. I have a pair of Levi's 505 straight-leg jeans, and I would recommend the 501s over those. While they are similar in look, I find the 505s to be very constricting in the thigh and crotch area; it took me a wash before those fit tolerably well, whereas the 501s fit amazingly right from the starta perfect mix of snugness and openness.

This is my first pair of 501s and I bought them mainly to wear with cowboy boots and they look amazing; buy them in a dark wash (I recommend Clean Rigid, the darkest blue wash available and the color I bought them in) and pair them with some black or dark brown cowboy boots and a slick dress shirt, and you've got an effortless, put-together look with a country charm.

I love these jeans and will likely buy another, shorter pair soon to wear with dress shoes. I'll update this review if I have anything to add then.

B000YXC2LI,,"I had many, many jeans. The 501 is probably the most comfortable jeans for daily use. Heavy material, good fit, and evenly distributed weight over my hip. All other jeans I had (including other Levi's) gave me bad pressure on certain area of my hip as the hip area is either too small or too big. I am 5""10, 145lb with skinny altheletic build, and the cut is just perfect. Compare to my 511 or 517, this is far more superior in everyway.

However, the manufacture consistency is very poor. I ordered two pairs of jeans. While both labeled the same size, one is an inch wider then the other. I highly recommend buying 2-3 pairs and return the ones that don't fit. In most cases, all of them will feel different. Shame on Levi's with no quality control, one star off for that.

Conclusion is, 501 is really well made as long as the fit is good. If you do not like button fly, go with 505 instead, which is exactly the same jeans with zipper fly. I cannot say for people with super skinny or chubby body, but for average shape people, 501 will fit well and comfortable through out the day.",4,"Good fit, good material, bad manufacture"

This particular pair is perfect - the fabric is lightweight and the fit was spot on - even through the ol Daddy bulge.  A word of caution though - I ordered what I thought to be an identical pair in a lighter color and the fit on those was NOT the same.  The Jean material was MUCH thicker and the fit clunky.

It's the rise!!!  These are a higher rise than most jeans.  I measured the rise on the 541 as 11"".  The rise on the 501 was 14.5""!  So, when I wear these jeans at my waist like usual, the extra rise pushes everything down and now the jeans are way too long because the crotch is hanging lower.

He fishes, hunts, works on cars, just an all around outdoorsman, and he is always wearing his Levi's. I usually buy them at the mall, but decided to try Amazon since I have Prime and get free shipping.

B000YXC2LI,,Excellent,5,Five Stars
B000YXC2LI,6.0,Regarding all of the reviews about these. Nowhere did it say that the jeans were already prewashed and preshrunk. THEY ARE!!!  So if your looking for ready to wear Levi's 501 Original jeans. This is what you need!!!  If you want the pain of washing and drying to fit. Get the ones that say SHRINK TO FIT. The package arrived on time. Nicely packaged. I examined them with a fine tooth comb. All seams were professionally sewn. No little threads hanging out. The denim seemed like I remember my old ones. I figure I'll wear these awhile. Then was in cold water. Dry on low or permanent press setting. Of course they'll fade with time. Also be alot more comfortable. Who cares where they're made. Mine are from Mexico. But the quality control of Levi Strauss seems to be working. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend these!! Plus they were an excellent buy at $39.00!!,5,These are very nice!
B000YXC2LI,,They fot great and feel great too! I love the button up front! They did bleed though do becareful the first few washes. I wll be buying more.,5,Awesome selection.

The fit has changed with way too much room in the seat, the Old Style Double seam down the inseam is not a skimpy little one seam, and the bottom hem is about 1/3 the size it was being only about 3/16 of an inch causing the pants to roll up.

I don't know, I keep looking for New Old Stock or even well cared for 501's everywhere now because I'll NEVER WEAR the new cheap version that Levis is trying to push on the public.

Boy, after putting them on, I recalled why I stopped buying Levis several years before. They feel cheap. My Wranglers are much stronger (I wear them while horseback riding), and I never feel as if they are about to split. These 501s were nearly twice what I pay for other jeans, and feel fragile, as if they'll split. Their weight is far too light, and nothing like the Levis I once wore. I will never buy a pair again. I would have returned these except that I really wanted to wear my new shoes last night, and these were the only jeans short enough.",1,What a shame.

B000YXC2LI,9.0,"Levi's material quality seems to have decreased over the past couple of years.  I could be wrong, but It feels like a lighter weight denim now than it used to be.  Where they used to last for several years, virtually every pair I've purchased more recently has torn very easily in the crotch area - and not at a seam.  The cloth itself fails, and it's imposible to repair or patch at that location.  I have at least 12-15 pairs which have failed in the same area - the most recent after only a few weeks, and wearing them only 3-4 times.  I've always loved Levi's in various styles, but going to have to look for a different brand and start making comparisons.",3,Not What They  Used To Be

The pant arrived on time and fit as expected. The fabric is what you expect from Levi's jeans.

However the quality of the pant is not what you would expect from Levi's. My main complaints are:

1. one of the buttons is stained. (see pic)
2. the stitches were defective and imprecise (see pictures) on the leg and on the fly. The stitches bleed out all across the leg and the machine seemed to have pulled the fabric creating ""bumps"".

But when I put on a pair of these modern 501s, they fit like I expect jeans to fit, which is to say close but not snug, with no bagging/sagging around the butt. A good, classic fit. (I'm 6' tall and of average build and just under the line of what would be considered overweight.)

B000YXC2LI,,"These Levi's 501 are not the shrink-to-fit jeans I wore years ago...they're actually better because they fit ""right out of the box"" and because they're pre shrunk/washed they're very comfortable.  I had to learn this the hard way because I never knew Levi's 501's came any other way but shrink-to-fit...I purchased another pair for the same price from a different vendor 3 inches wider in the waist, soaked them in hot water for an hour and hung them up to dry.  The money I saved, and then some, I ended up spending having them altered to fit me.  I will say that the material is still heavyweight like I expected, just a little softer and comfortable to wear.",5,Not the same 501's I wore back in the day...but every bit as good

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"I returned them as they were cut weird.
I have worn these jeans for over 30 years and have noticed since they are made in several different places on earth and being cut in large amounts, the sizes are way off. It has nothing to do with the seller. It has to do with where they are made.
If any of you wonder why when you buy the same size jeans and they don't fit like your other ones, this is why.
It took doing some research to find out why my jeans quit fitting right when buying the same size.
There is an inside label that will tell you where they were made. This explains part of the problem of why they don't fit right, or why you can try on several pairs of the same labeled size and they all fit different.
I have learned it is well worth the effort to try on several pair of the same size to find the one that works for you.
This particular pair was uncomfortably tight in the thighs, which has never been an issue before with these jeans.",2,Didn't fit right

I have always worn 36/32 and can walk into any store and grab one off the rack and purchase it knowing that it will fit. I saw the levi's special of the day and thought I would get a pair for work and didn't think too much of it. It arrived on time which is the only thing I have good to say about the purchasing experience. The tag on the jeans says 36/32 but I measured it and it is 32/32, which is a relief since it no where near fit me. The other huge disappointment is the material this pair of jeans were made of. Like I said before, I've been wearing 501s for years and I've never had a pair that the denim was so thin, I mean paper thin. The levi's tag on the3 seam of the pocket was badly sewn on and the badge sewn on the waist was crooked which makes me wonder if these are Levi's at all.",1,Do Not Buy Jeans From Levi's Online

I expected them to shrink. Tried them on, seem normal a little long but a washing should make them just right. The label says 501 and size says its what I have been ordering for many years. I ordered 3 pair several months ago (From Amazon) everything the same and they did shrink to fit. I give this order 3 stars. In retrospect I should have notice that the denim didn't feel the same .

B000YXC2LI,,"I did not buy new 501 Levis from Amazon because I could not trust the sizing--both from reviews and from inadequate produce descriptions.  Even in the past when I bought Levi 501 regularly in stores, sizing was dangerous because they always would shrink in a unpredictable way--but for sure shrink a lot.  Here, it is not even clear what shrinkage in 501s, if any, can be expected.  Also, several reviews make me think that Levis are now manufactured from many, and sometimes unreliable, sources.  I was amazed to read from some reviewers that their Levis wore holes after just 4 months.  So, reluctantly as a regular Amazon customer, I can't buy Levis online.",1,"Reluctantly, didn't dare buy Levi 501s online"

I decided I couldn't trust buying here but I went to Belks and bought a pair  (they were the same price $39).  They were just fine, pretty much just like always.

I could tell a minor difference in the stitching of the hem (slightly narrower) and the buttons of the button fly look a tiny bit shinier but other than that they were exactly the same as the first pairs I bought in the 1970s.

Also the hem at the bottom of the legs is smaller, thus they have a tendency to roll up when washed, it looks strange and it's hard to get them to lie straight like they are suppose to.

B000YXC2LI,20.0,Disappointing. I bought a few and all fit well when I tried them on. The problem I had with the jeans came up as I washed them before I used them. I have some kind of OCD thing when it comes to folding my jeans. I have to line up the bottom hems up first before I fold them. I noticed that Levi decided to shorten the bottom hem so no matter what I do they curl upwards. They went from appoxamatly 1/4 inch to less then 1/8 of an inch. The other thing I dislike is the number of tags they added to inside of the jeans. I'm a big guy and wear my jeans around the gut not under. The tags some how work them selfs up and out the top. That's not a biggy and is easily handled with some sissors. I noticed that stitching has gone down in quality from my older jeans. I put a 5 or so year old jeans on top of the new ones and saw the one ones just don't feel as durable as the old ones. I loved Levi's until I got these. The price has gone up while the quality has gone down. I think I will be switching over to wranglers because they cheaper and fit better. I have a few wranglers and they are double stitched in places where Levi's are only single stitched.,2,Time to switch to a different brand

B000YXC2LI,,"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

Also, i have been wearing the same size 30x30 since i was 19; I am now 40 :-( The other reviews are correct in that it seems the material is thinner. The jeans fray quicker with washes. However, I am a believer that jeans are not meant to be washed regularly. If I am not mistaken, even Levi Strauss recommends that their jeans are not to be washed often as it breaks down the fabric (from personal experiance; this is true). Actually, the thinner material makes them even more comfortable.

Levis was my go-to for jeans. Sadly, no more. I don't know what has happened to their quality, but someone along the line in whoever is managing their manufacturing has really dropped the ball. I got four pairs of jeans, two stonewashed, and two black, and every pair ripped in the crotch within two months. I am accustomed to a certain amount of wear over time in the inseam, but this is completely unacceptable.

I'm not the kind of guy who goes around doing Chuck Norris moves on random passers by in the street. I walk normally, act normally, and move pretty much like the average American in a typical casual office setting would move when walking from one place to the next. I do not think that my expectations are particularly high to think that I can enjoy this style of motion in my life without worrying about my jeans splitting so rapidly.

B000YXC2LI,,"How strange they can't move production off-shore and get it right! There have been conscious changes in design that detract from the classic 501 look.

Throughout the run I viewed, dozens at a local JC Penny, the thread was the wrong color; yellow not gold. I have looked at these for years and see the same sort of ""mistakes"".
The rear pockets have been given s strange flared look, not like in the photos here.
They can't even get the ""W"" on the rear pocket right! At least a little better than I have seen in the past that looked sewn by drunks!

The fit was ok and the color of the denim pretty good BUT if like me you have worn these jeans since th 60's it's easy to spot the weird differences and while if you landed from another planet and had no idea you may find them just great but not me.

I went with some Lee's. To long time Lee wearers there may be the same complaints but the Lee's are $42 and Levis $68 where I looked! ($26 vs $46 on Amazon). Wranglers also looked nicer but don't fit me right and were mid way in price.

Those I saw were made in Columbia and I was sure I had a pair of USA 501's on and checked and they are also made in Columbia! MIne are exact replica's of the 70's 501's I'm used to. Got them at a thrift store 3 years ago and have no idea of their vintage but a superior pants.

But again, the IDIOTS at Levi's made a change in perfection and I'll stick with something else until they can find the old patterns and thread and hire sober tailors!

I have purchased two pair of these jeans in this color, of different sizes, and without fail they begin to tear at the back pockets within about two months. This problem has not been experienced with other, regular washes. Only with the blue mist or other lighter in color washes. I don't know whether the process they use to get the lighter color weakens the fabric, or if they start with cheaper fabric on these items, but they fall apart quickly. Save your money.

B000YXC2LI,3.0,Levis....what has happened?? In just a few months these Jeans are ripped out in the crotch.  Usually it takes years for Levis to fall apart.  I would also like to mention = what is with sewing the pocket so your index finger gets stuck in the seem on the way down???  The first thing I do is cut the 1/2 inch of thread off the pocket where you decided to sew up the side of the  pocket instead of stopping at the corner.  This way my finger doesn't get stuck in the pocket on the way down.  Quality has really dropped and I've been a lifelong 501 Levis buyer and the last 3 or 4 years of Levis are just getting worse and worse.,1,From the Mind of Bob

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"No Longer the jeans of a generation or two. I am 63yrs. old and probably have 20 pair of Levi 501's. The jeans of the baby boomers and then some. But all good things, they have come to the end. DO NOT BY THESE JEANS ON LINE!!!! Their are about five types of denim now being used, and the quality ranges from ""just like it was in the eighties to, what the hell are these things"". The only thing consistent about the 501's (and the 514's) is that the inconsistency in both fit, size, and especially quality is astounding. I called Levi's myself, and they are aware of the inconsistentency in their products. They have opened up new factories so quickly, that the problem went unnoticed for almost 2 years. They were very honest with me, and are working diligently to alleviate the problem. Eighteen pair of mine are perfect in every way. All are consistent in every way. The last two pair I purchased were off to each other in every way. The waist and inseam are off as much as 3/4 of an inch. When I put my wallet in the back pocket on one new pair, The back pocket ripped @ the corner. That when I called them, and they admitted that the weight of the denim was one of the problems. They gave me a credit for a new pair. However, the difference between old and new was to great. Again, go to an Army store if you can, but do not buy on line. Let the buyer beware!!!",1,"But all good things, they have come to the end"

Like possibly when it was made it had some type of drying machine that left wrinkles only on parts of the jeans.
Not going to return these but clearly with this material and the more snugger fit than I wanted these will become dry clean only to avoid any further disaster..slowly beginning to believe I must buy Levi's locally to ensure the quality and texture I'm getting first and foremost.

It makes me wonder if they are knock offs because the overall impression of them is sketchy at best. In both pairs there are tags that say ""made in Egypt"" and then information on the other side written in Chinese. I have always trusted Amazon to deal with approved vendors who meet certain standards. This time I'm skeptical if I genuinely received what I expected. I would not reorder from this vendor.",1,Could These be Knockoffs ?

After researching on line, I discovered that Levi's changed the cuts of their basic line and now has a wide variety of fits, which probably accounts for the 501's being cut a little leaner in the leg and crotch. I'll take it as my bad for not being a better informed shopper. At least one thing about Levi's that hopefully will never change: I can trade these for ones that fit just about anywhere that sells them, no questions asked.",4,There're more than just 501's

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I wore 501 shrink to fit for 40+ years and always loved them. The last batch wore out so I bought these. The material is very weak compared to what it used to be. Worse, they must be cut differently because they slid down when I didn't have a belt on. Worse than that, when I put a belt on, there were not enough belt loops (only 5) so on each side in the back, the belt rode up over the pants until the belt was in direct contact with my skin. I was walking all over the territory constantly reaching back to pull my pants up in public to get the pants back under the belt. ENOUGH!
I was going to take them down to the local thrift store to donate but then thought why plague someone else with this problem? I threw them in the trash where they belong. Now I buy other jeans that fit fine and have 7 belt loops. What a relief! Bye bye Levi, I'm sad things didn't work out.",1,"Goodbye Levi, I threw the jeans in the trash"

Maybe they will shrink right but that is only part of the problem.  The description said ""Rigid.""  That they aren't.  The last pair I bought in Texas was indeed rigid.  This pair is inferior denim, as light weight as the cheaper jeans made in China.  These were made in Egypt and it shows.  The big disappointment though was that they came pre-wrinkled at the top.  I have seen this style on the Levis website and would had definitely avoided it, had I known.  The photo show does not show wrinkles up close.

B000YXC2LI,,"Still breaking these in, but I'll probably get another pair.  Good jeans, historically.  I like the fit.  They're not the body-conscious, skinny-jeans type fit that you see almost everywhere today, but they're not baggy either.  I would say if you're looking to fit your booty but not ostentatiously, this may be the way to go.  Maybe size down one in the waist if you want a more body-conscious butt fit (some of us are more posterior-impaired than others).  I wear a 31/32 in khakis, but not worn around the waist, and that's a slim-fit, great on the rear.  For jeans I wanted something a little more comfortable.  I think these will shrink a bit to fit.

Update:  I have bought four pairs of these jeans now.  Except for one of them, the colors were all true to the website image.  One, ""cascade wonderland,"" looks like a flat cobalt or lapis blue on the website.  What was sent to me looked like black jeans that had aged badly, just ugly in a thrifting kind of way (and I usually like thrift store things, but sometimes...).  Sent them back.  The replacement, in lodestone, is great.  It's kind of khaki-colored, but really more of a gold.  Great fall color.",4,You can still stand by the old standby
B000YXC2LI,,"Bought him a pair of button-fly 501s in Rinse for Christmas.  He wants to wear them every day.  He loves the button fly -- easy way to make sure your fly is never down!  The fit is perfect (32 x 30, he is 5'10"" & 160 lbs) and makes his butt look great.  The darker wash looks great for every day wear, and even crisp enough to wear as business casual.  I found in my shopping, too, that Amazon offered one of the best deals -- I bought these for $46, about the same price I would have paid at the holiday sales at Kohl's (except I never had to get out of my jammies to get my shopping done.  Huzzah!).  Saving up his clothes budget now to buy another pair!",5,Husband's favorite jeans

To be honest I haven't bought a pair of 501's in years, and have settled for the cheap Kirkland brand at Costco or other cheaper brands, only to have them wear out in what seemed a very short time. After ordering these and doing a direct comparison of both side by side, it is quickly apparent that Levi's brand uses a much heavier denim, giving the jeans a much more solid feel and what seems to be a better fit. 3 times the price but 4 times as nice!

They were for my son and the fit was actually spot on, and they did look good though they did seem a little lighter weight than other Levi's we both own. After half a day on the first wear they were in worse shape than Levi's he has worn for over three years. The inseams wore; the seams began to separate; and there were holes in the crotch on both legs. Completely unacceptable when you can't wear a new pair of pants for an entire day without having to throw them out. Needless to say I am returning them.

B000YXC2LI,,"I grew up a loyal 501's customer into my early 20's. After a 20 year hiatus, I decided I would treat myself to a new pair of my favorite jeans, determined to never wear a different pair of jeans again. For me...501's or bust! Unfortunately, some changes have taken place over the years that I was unaware of. It appears that these jeans have a much different cut than they did in the past. While they fit at the waist and the length is perfect, they are tight throughout...and I'm skinny! First question my wife had for me was ""What's the difference between those jeans and skinny jeans?"" I don't know! Furthermore, the new cut presents a defect in the rear, at least on the pair that I bought from Sears. Some weird new cut pouch has been created just above the back pockets. So now, when I'm wearing jeans that I'm supposed to be proud of, people can wonder to themselves ""Why does that guy have a back pocket pouch?"" I bought the jeans at Sears where I am disallowed to return them unless there's a defect. I don't know if they'll accept ""back pocket pouch"" as a defect and my suspicion is that an exchange will only provide me with an additional pair of ""back pocket pouch"" jeans. After 20 years of anticipation, it's unfortunate that my return to Levi's 501's was so disappointing. I won't refrain from recommending these to others, but try them on before purchasing. They are not your fathers Levis. As for me, I've transitioned to the Wrangler rigid cowboy cut jeans and while they are not Levi's, I like the cut (I can wear them with boots or sneakers) and the heavy denim of the jeans.

PS- I did write Levis concerning the new cut. I have included the response I received: We occasionally update our products based on consumer feedback and demand. Im sorry the recent update hasn't worked for you. Ill share your thoughts with our product managers, as they pay close attention to consumer feedback.",2,Not the Same As It Ever Was

B000YXC2LI,3.0,"It's really disappointing that a name like Levi's would take advantage of their [now changed] reputation by passing off poor quality articles.  These pants are not worthy of the Levi's label, or perhaps it is, because now to me Levi's stands for ""gamble"", ""not trustworthy""...The material cannot even be called ""Denim"" anymore.  Like other jeans on the market, the twill is a lightweight flannel-like material that are apparently designed to disintegrate more quickly such that you are forced to buy (subscribe to) more jeans.  It's a wasteful process and such a shame. I was hoping I could dodge all the low quality crap and go with a tried and true brand such as Levi's, but they seem to be no different from the rest.  There is no reason why a made in U.S. jean by an American brand should cost $200 a pair.  If you find a reasonably priced pair of Levi's, like these, it's because they are made in Mexico or China of inferior ingredients and craftsmanship.  I'm truly heartbroken.  It's the end of an icon.",1,Sad and disappointed. Maybe I'm old fashioned

B000YXC2LI,,"Although this pair fit as expected, the reason I ordered them is that a meddling friend told me that the 505's I just got were not for slim people; they said that the 501's would fit tighter and more like when I was a teenager (I'm now 57).  Since I recently slimmed down, I was excited to feel that sexy lean look in my slim pair of Levi's (been wearing Wranglers for the last 15 years because I'd gained weight).  Well, what she did not tell me was that they had a button front --- definitely NOT what I wore in high school and college!  And my stubby hands could not even button more than one button.  It was just too hard!  She was also wrong about the 505's being more roomy.  The fit of the 501's was the same as the 505's.  The reason for my writing is to encourage Amazon to put the ""button front"" in bolds or something, so people know not to buy that when they want a zipper front.",4,Button Fly Hard to Manage

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I bought two pairs of the 501 Levi's for $30 each about 7 years ago. These pairs lasted for about 6 years with regular use and key to this story, they both wore out in the thighs (not the crotch) - where I expect bluejeans to wear out. I loved them. A year ago it was finally time to replace my old jeans. I bought another two pairs of the 501 Levi's, which had gone up $20 per pair, but no problem: I loved the other pairs so much that I was willing to spend $50 on each new pair of jeans.

Fast forward four months. A hole appeared in the crotch of Pair #1. Bummer, but on to Pair #2...

...8 months later, a hole in the same place on Pair #2 - I haven't been walking any differently than before, I have not been doing splits, and I haven't started getting lap dances or anything. Okay, time to talk to the company.

So I read up on the Levi lifetime warranty for defects in material and workmanship. Surely this batch of Levi's were defective. I took both pairs to a Levi Outlet Store. The sales clerk inspected the pants. He thought for a little while. And he reached a judgement: the holes were from normal use. I explained that I was living my life in the same way as before, but he already has his conclusion. After I expressed my disappointment in the quality of these pants and that Levi was not going to honor their warranty, the sales associate, as a last resort to get me out of his store, offered me a discount on a new pair. I decided that no, in fact I would not pay any more money for jeans that have a lifespan of months. Also, I will not buy any more jeans from Levi because I feel that they have been insincere in their warranty and to their customers, and they are making second-rate jeans.",1,"Higher Price, Lower Quality"

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Day 2 of wearing these, the top rivet breaks off. We have a neighbor who is very crafty and likes to sew, asked if she could repair, she says sure - and so I get them back, almost good as new. (which as it turns out, isn't saying a whole lot) The ""new"" rivet is slightly different shade of metal - big whoop. So I wear them for a few more days, and go t put them in the wash when I notice the very back belt loop has torn off from the bottom.

Look on the label, made in Indonesia.

These jeans are pure, unadulterated CRAP. The Levi's name used to mean something.

Lesson learned for me. One more brand to add to the ""Do not buy"" list.",1,Simple truth - these are trash. Levis should be ashamed to put their name on these.

It is a slightly different material than typical blue version - a little thinner, as specified. But the length ended up more like what I expect from a 32"" inseam. Anyway, that's not too short for me and they fit great otherwise. I will try 33/36 if buying black again.",4,Darn shrinkage!
B000YXC2LI,,"Ultimately, I returned these because they were too tight on my upper thighs.  I was really sad to do it, though, because they looked great.  I was just worried that the pressure of my apparently huge thighs would cause these to rip.

B000YXC2LI,,"For years I've lamented the loss of the feel of the original Levi's 501 button fly jean.  Although I grew comfortable with the feel of my relaxed fit Old Navy jeans, I always felt there was just something missing.  When I found the original 501's on Amazon, I just had to try them!  My order arrived when promised, and was carefully boxed and packaged in individually sealed plastic packets.  When I opened the packets and tried them on it was like returning home for the first time after a 35 year absence!  Just like I remembered, they fit snug to your body at first, but then conformed to your individual curves with a couple of hours of wear.  I'm a guy who has been wearing zip fly jeans for the last 35 years, so the button fly takes a little getting used to again, but the feeling of wearing the jeans I grew up in is un-paralleled! The jeans feel comfortable, strong and durable, with a classic style that could last forever.  And, since I no longer climb trees and playground fences, or wrestle groups of boys on gravel roads, they just might last that long!",5,A Return To The Good Ol' Days!

No, these were somehow pre-faded. Yuck,  What the Heck, man?  And the fit?  Well, apparently they were pre-shrunk as well. they're too big in the waist, too long in the length and I hate the even fade.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Twenty years ago, you could sell these jeans for several hundreds of dollars per pair abroad. They are the button fly, the classic Levi's jeans before zippers were invented. If you are a man, getting a sensitive area caught in the zipper is excruciating. This only happened once to me, and I switched to button fly. They are a classic fit, very favorable to your physique, durable and comfortable. They only come in about four or five colors to my knowledge, but this is a small price to pay for what will undoubtedly become your favorite pair of jeans for everywhere. Today, it seems that everyone the world over prefers to wear jeans. Even corporate positions have relaxed their dress codes, and casual and comfortable has become the norm. You can wear them with a sport coat to dress it up a bit. I always prefer to honor the inventor or originator of any product, and Levi was absolutely the first to make a pair of jeans, as I recall in the late 1800's or early 1900's in San Francisco for the gold miners. Since then, so many people have tried to copy them, but, in my opinion, Levi's are still the best. There are more durable jeans, the ones made from canvas or firehose sheathing fabric, and I have to admit I own several pair of these for work. But for just knocking around in, Levi's are the most comfortable. If you've never owned a pair of button fly Levi's, I strongly recommend you try a pair...you'll be hooked.",5,Levi's 501 jeans are a Classic.

B000YXC2LI,,"I have been wearing 501's since the 80's. Levi's has allowed the quality to slip gradually over the years. I purchased 3 pairs of 501's 2 months ago, all made in Mexico which in my experience seems to have been the highest quality over the last few years. All 3 pairs have popped a belt loop in the 2 months in which I have been wearing them. A pair of jeans should last longer than 2 months in my opinion. I will never buy Levi's again. I will be buying one of the few American made brands out there. Sure they cost 3 times as much, but at that price they only have to last for 6 months to be more cost effective then the junk Levi's is putting out these days. If it has the bonus of giving an American a job, even better.",1,even better.

I tried the 501s and I love them! They fit like 514s but with WAY better denim fabric and they sit on your seat way better. 514s sit below the waist which apparently sucks when comparing it to sitting above the waist. For record I got the rinse wash color. It's a quality thick denim. THEY ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL 501s. EVERYONE CHILL OUT. if you want those, buy the shrink-to-fit line (STF). The tag on the back right pocket will say shrink to fit (if you are buying in a store, otherwise amazon will say it in the headline).

Like most of you have stated, I have worn them all my life, and now have about 4-5 pairs sitting in the top of my closet because they don't match the size on the label. Not even by a long shot. I would say some of them have to be 2"" off in waist size, and one pair is off by at least 4"" in length (too long). Sad that my jean company was hijacked by the bean counters, but glad to find out it isn't just me.

I've moved on Levi's. It will take a return to quality and consistency to get me back. Good luck.",1,I thought it was just me!
B000YXC2LI,,"I have a pair of 501s that was wearing out on the front of the thighs, so I ordered a replacement pair of 501s of the same wash and size (36Wx34L). The old pair was made in Mexico, but the new pair was made in China. The new pair felt tight on the first wear, but I thought that was just part of breaking in a new pair of denim jeans. However, after a few months of wearing and washing them, I decided to compare them to my old pair. The Chinese jeans were a little over 1 inch shorter in the inseam as measured from the crotch seam. Also, the Chinese jeans were 1 inch smaller in the waist compared to the Mexico-made jeans.

So, my 34Wx36L jeans from China are equivalent to 33Wx35L jeans from Mexico.

I don't think much has changed over the last 30 plus years, but I stopped wearing them for some reason. I was paying more for less from other brands. Fashion oriented jeans are great for that special occasion but they don't last. Buttons come off, they wear prematurely, come apart in the seems, or even blow out in the knees or seat. For an everyday jean that's an icon in the world of jeans, you can't do better than the 501. The fit and finish is superb. Dress them up, dress them down. Choose from a multitude of colors. What more could you ask for? I bought three pairs. They all fit the same.",5,The king of jeans

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"Levi 501 button-fly jeans are THE classic jeans. They're not too baggy, nor too skinny. Levi uses great denim, and the construction is good quality. These are clearly ""firsts"" as there are no defects. The dark stonewash is the right amount of broken-in without being already worn-out.
Amazon carries a full range of sizes, including the 34 waist with 38 inseam my husband wears, so they have been our go-to for his Levis since 2010. The price is usually $10 or $20 below retail, sometimes even more.
One complaint, though, is the number of tags. It seems like a horrible waste of paper and ink, especially when one considers the quantity of 501s sold in a year.

In a year of wearing once or twice a week (including time at work in a meat processing plant) they are still going strong and are showing no signs of wearing out.

The only thing that was surprising is that instead of a zipper in the front these jeans had five or so metal buttons to fasten. It was offsetting at first, but you get used to it after a while. I still would prefer a zipper though.",5,great pair of pants

B000YXC2LI,,"I bought my first pair of 501's almost 30 years ago and immediately fell in love with them.  I liked the fit and they lasted forever.  Since then 501's is all I would wear.  I can't even think of how many pairs of jeans I have bought during that time.  However, in the past couple years I have become very disappointed with them.  I use to be able to walk into the store, grab my size off the shelf and pay for them.  I would have sales people ask if I wanted to try them on and I would say ""no thanks, I know they fit"".  Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.  Sorry Levi's but you lost this loyal customer by making inferior product and charging too much for it!",1,Goodbye Levi's Hello Wrangler

If you ignore the fact that they are supposed to be Levi's, and how much you are paying for them, then they're okay. They're comfortable, and they fit as expected.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've been wearing Levis jeans since I was a teen 50 years ago and, while I still like the way they look and fit, it's true what others have said:  they last about half as long as they used to due to, I assume, thinner material of possibly lesser quality.  They always wear through in the same place, too, just above the left knee, followed shortly by the right.  Believe it or not, just last week I had 3 pair of 501s, light stone wash color, all rip through within a week of each other.  In the 60s-70s I suspect those same jeans, if available, would have lasted me at least a couple more years.

i can accept and understand how they  made it lighter/thinner this time....but what's disturbing with the Levi's i got are the craftsmanship....how the stitches were. 2 major horrible things I sadly noticed...1.) the stiches along side the pants( the entire length of the thigh area ...which is the outer side of the pants...the stitches were horribly loose.i have to take it to a tailor the next day to have it reinforced. my girlfriend keep telling me maybe It was a fake...but i am convinced with amazon's items.i mean if it's sold by them.i trusted Amazon. i still feel they're not knockoffs even though they scream of being one. 2.) i don't know the technical name...or what to call it. the bottom edge of the pants. my old levi's and even the photos on amazon....showed a somewhat right amount of fold.(am talking about the very bottom edge of the pants where it touches your feet) the folds on the Levi's that i got are so crazy thin.its about a quarter of an inch...as opposed to maybe half an inch...if we base on the photos and the old levi's that i have. this is when i started to feel cheated.the loose stitches i blame on the quality control or maybe the guy in Haiti who did the pants had a bad day. but the bottom fold is really disappointing and its not the same as shown in the pictures.

B000YXC2LI,,"I started wearing Levi's in Junior High School. I've worn them for 5 decades. That ""5"" is not a typo. In recent decades it has been 501s. Some wizard at Levi Strauss decided to ""update the cut"". That means they removed fabric to make them into ""low riders"". The belt line now rides where no adult male wants them to. They are uncomfortable and my shirt won't stay tucked in. They also have two less belt loops. My favorite, ""wear them every day pants"" have gone to hell!

It is interesting to note that some of the positive reviews have female names attached!

What to do? I was killing time in a boutique clothing store while my wife was shopping. They had a tiny men's section. I saw Carhartts on the shelf. I had nothing better to do, so I tried them on. They fit so well, I ignored the high ""boutique"" price. I found a little piece of heaven when I found the part number here on Amazon. Now with a 1-click finger stroke, I get a fresh pair of Carharts  that are comfortable. A half dozen pairs of usable Levi's will be rotting where they are headed.

B000YXC2LI,,"Why Amazon for your Levi's? Sizes you can't get in a store and competitive pricing. For those who complain these aren't the heavy duty 501's of old, you are right. Those were the originals where you bought them several inches larger and threw them in hot water to shrink them to size. They were a thicker fabric. I have not seen those throw backs in a store in years. So I suspect the company no longer offers those originals anymore. These are still good and in some ways better. They are more comfortable because they don't have that stiff canvas feel of the originals. It took 3 months of washing to get the originals to soften up. They will fit better right off the counter. You still account for a small amount of shrinkage since they are 100% cotton. It is best to wash in cold water.  The dark rinse is a good pant if you want a nicer look. I bought my pairs with a 20% promotion. I am very happy with the purchase.",3,"Not the 501's of old, But still the best Jean out there."

I had just bought a new pair of these from Kohl's, but then found the odd waist sizes on Amazon, which Kohl's didn't have (only even numbers). Being a complete nerd, I bundled them both up and weighed them, looking for a difference in material weight. After accounting for the 1-inch waist size difference, their weights were identical.

After purchasing a new pair, I have decided to assign a two-star rating because the new denim is not comfortable, and the fit (specifically, the low rise) is questionable.  To me, the jeans are tedious to wear.  It may actually be that I would now better appreciate a more relaxed cut.  But especially after looking at other recent Levi's reviews, I'm thinking to involve another brand.  Bottom line: I will keep these jeans since they're wearable and since I've already removed the tags, but I'm thankful to have managed to cancel an order for a second pair.",2,Expected better from Levi's

I bought two pairs and both have a strange streak of white in the right leg above the knee. Its actually in the denim material - not a stain. Also all pockets have excess loose treads on the pocket seems that required cutting off. The fit was fine. Overall, the quality is what you would get for knock off jeans at a discount store - not for premium jeans.",3,Not what I expected
B000YXC2LI,,"I can never find jeans in my size, but I like the way 501s fit.  The jeans show up a little large, but shrink slightly to fit fine.  They hold their color well over several washings.

Only downside... no sale pricing.",5,Only place I can find 35x30 Levi's.

This last pair fits more like a 34 than a 35 but that's what you get for buying clothes without trying them on first.  Still, the quality is as good as Levi's reputation.

B000YXC2LI,,"As I read all the negative reviews of these Levi's, how the material was thinner than usual and the unusual wrinkles in the back and the front, I hoped that I would find these pants exactly that way.  I am a solo piano player and play many gigs in my area, and I wanted some black pants that were less heavy than regular black Levi's. I choose these polished black pants, hoping that they would be between dress pants and the regular Levi variety, and these are perfect.  The rivets are black, too, which I really like, and like all 501 Levi's, which I have been wearing as far back as I can remember (I'm now 70 years old), they fit perfectly.  I will definitely be ordering a second pair of these pants.",5,Exactly what I was hoping for!
B000YXC2LI,,"these jeans fit well, for those of you who like the Thicker Levi's you will be disappointed with these since the material is very thin, personally I like that but they aren't what they used to be as far as quality of material.  Other then that they fit  and look good.",5,Nice but thinner material used.
B000YXC2LI,,I have been wearing these pants since I was a teenager and they have actually gotten better over the years because they have stone-washed them so they are soft and faded from day one and no longer take months to break in and fade.

B000YXC2LI,,"The problem with Levis is that they have terrible quality control. 501 button down jeans should have the same number of buttons on every pair that I order. Some have more, some have less and some are in different positions. The other problem with this pair of jeans is that within two weeks of ordering on of the belt loops came loose. I will try to return these.",1,Not as happy with Levis as I used to be...
B000YXC2LI,,"I can only echo what other reviewers have written here.  These are NOT Levi's 501s.

I would have paid far more for a jean that last like the 501s I used to wear and fits and looks as good.

B000YXC2LI,,"I've learned a valuable lesson: When ordering jeans, read the fine print.  I would have sworn there was no mention of a button fly; but when I received the jeans I went back and looked and there it was.  Since the last time I confronted a button fly was in the 1940s, I was not conditioned to be wary of inadvertently ordering such pants.  Levi's, there was a reason the button fly was replaced by a zipper.  The passage of time has not brought back the 'charm' of such an antiquated device.  If you're a septuagenarian as I am, with arthritic hands, DO NOT order these jeans.",2,Button Fly?

Yes, the last four pair I have purchased from Amazon and they last about six-to-eight months. The inseam has torn on two pair, making them unwearable. And this is only from casual use!!! I remember the days when I used to wear Levi's as a work pant, and they would last through years of heavy abuse. Now, with this thinner material, you could easily destroy a brand new pair by just getting into a car.
I will certainly check the quality of Levi's 501 at a local store, but if it's the same paper thin junk that Amazon sells, I will have no other choice but to find a new brand. I still find it hard to believe that my brand has been totally ruined.",1,Thin material rips early and often.

However as someone who used to own multiple pairs of 501's years ago I was sorely disappointed.  The cut is not what it used to be.  These pants should have fit my butt perfectly, but it seems the cut is now a bit saggy in the butt and crotch.  The material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what I remember too.  Original fit???  Shrink to fit???  Nope nada no way!  I have already washed them and there was no shrink to fit.  My pair of jeans were made in Malaysia.

I recommend going to a brick and mortar store and trying out various brands and sizes as Levi's which I used to be able to buy just by size is no longer what it used to be.

The one downside I found was the button fly.  This didn't bother me soo much when I was younger but now I would much prefer a zipper to dealing with buttons.  Perhaps it is because I generally wear a belt now and it is very difficult to do the buttons up without undoing the belt and top button.",4,Can't beat a classic.

We were very cautious about another buy; read reviews on Amazon and found some similar poor remarks.  In the meanwhile, we visited a major retailer and could see that there were various ""washes"" which relate to the softness, overall wearability of the fabric.  So we were careful to choose the Medium Stonewash, which came out of the dryer in a ready-to-wear condition.  So, don't yet give up on Levis.

Mexico always makes the pants that fit perfectly for whatever size needed. I gained weight and needed 35"" waisted pants, something impossible to find in stores, so I ended up buying them from The Levi's Store online - and never had a problem with the sizing. I've now lost some weight and need 33"" waisted pants. Just bought 2 pair from Amazon (they were about the same cost but 2 day free shipping on Amazon). The other pair was 33""x32"" 501s called ""Bleached"" - tried them on - and PERFECT. Checked the tag and yup - made in Mexico. (On a side note, Amazon's website shows that ALL their 501s are made in Mexico which is a total lie). When I tried this pair on, they were TIGHT! Aside from barely able to getting them up, the button-up fly eyes weren't the normal size - I could barely get the button through the buttonhole on every single button. Got them all buttoned up and - ack - I could barely breath! Had just as much problem getting the button fly OPEN as I did closing it - then it took an extra hand to peel the pant leg off. I checked the tag and - made in Mexica? HAHAHA, no, no, no. They were made in Egypt! Any pants I've receive made in Egypt, Burma, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia - anywhere but Mexico - they are too small!

But let's not speak of the discrepancy on Amazons part re: that I bought Levi 501 34x32 the first time and the second time yet Amazon begins their strange and rude requirement by printing in large type that I bought 33x32.

Honestly, I cannot for the life of me imagine why they would ""require""d anything of a customer who's paid his bill, and then to do so when Amazon cannot get their facts straight. I'd call this a careless error followed by an insult. We, your customers butter your bread, that is, after we provide the bread.

B000YXC2LI,5.0,"As many reviewers have noted these are not the Levi's 501s of old.  At all.  Below I will list several characteristics that make them inferior, but, in the end, they're okay jeans, I guess.  Just not Levi's 501s.  In other words, they're sturdy enough and aren't falling apart.  And they have the classic Levi's label.  But they aren't the Levi's we grew up with.  At all.  Here's why:

--Inferior fabric.  The denim used is not as thick, not even close, and the ""weave"" (I don't know the technical term) isn't as good as you can see a sort of grain in the fabric that are clearly indicative of inferior fabric.  It's not super thin, but it's not nearly as heavy as classic Levi's.

--Fewer belt loops!  I know, right?!  There are two belt loops on the front, like normal, and two on the side.  Then, where there are normally two on the back that are opposite the two front ones, and then a middle one in the back?  The two opposite the front ones are eliminated!  So, you go from two side loops to one in the back.  That's it!  And it's not that the other two back ones fell off or something, they just aren't there.  Why?  I'm guessing that after several dozen pair of jeans you save enough fabric that way to make another pair.  Heck if I know, but it's annoying.  You might not think it would be, but, I have to say, I notice it every single time I put them on.

--The feel is wrong.  This is probably a repeat of the fabric listing above, but it kind of requires repeating.  The fabric just isn't as sturdy, so they don't feel like Levi's.  They feel cheap.  And that's a shame.

Again, as I say, if you're just after a pair of jeans with a Levi's label with your waist and inseam size printed on it, these will work and from a distance they look enough like classic Levi's that I reckon they'll do.  But if you're after a pair of classic Levi's 501s, don't buy these.  They aren't the jeans you're looking for.  Not even close.",2,"Okay as jeans, but these are *not* the Levi's 501s you grew up with"

B000YXC2LI,,"In my quest for the perfect pair of 501's I have discovered that the quality varies widely by the country of origin.  If I had to rank the countries that I have seen listed on 501 tags, I would rank them as:

Turkey >= Dominican Republic >> Mexico

OBSERVATIONS BY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:

Turkey -- I bought this pair of 501's at the Levi store in London, England on Regent Street.  The quality is higher than I have observed at any retail store in the United States.  The fabric is heavy yet soft, and the stitching appears to be high quality.  Bought without hesitation.

Dominican Republic -- I bought this pair of 501's at a T.J. Maxx store in the United States.  The quality is on par with that of Turkey above, yet they were sold at T.J. Maxx due to a minor irregularity in the fabric near the bottom of one leg.  Bought without hesitation.

Mexico -- I have seen 501's for sale that were manufactured in Mexico.  The fabric is significantly thinner/lighter and more flexible.  Stitching appeared clumsy rather than precise.  Did not buy.

The quest for perfect 501's continues.  I will update this review as I discover more.",5,WARNING:  Quality varies widely by country of origin
B000YXC2LI,,"I chose to have the Levis fit a bit loose and that's what I got, perfect! Understanding that Levis do shrink when washed.",5,Nice fit.

B000YXC2LI,,At 72 I've tried them all and can say without equivocation that no jean fits my body as well as Levi's 501s. I've been wearing them since I was out of diapers and will wear them to the other-side.,5,No jeans as good as 501s!

B000YXC2LI,,"Of course it's nice when things change for the better and just as sweet when the small close to perfect things in life remain unchanged by time. This is the case with these Levi's 501 jeans.

For decades my favorite jeans of all time. Countless designers and brands have tried to tap into the 501's iconic popularity but at the end of the day have always failed to do so.

These are exactly how I remember them:

* Heavy Denim

* Re-enforced flawless stitching on all pockets, hems, waist line and inner leg.

* Solid brass rivets on pockets

* The classic brass rivet button fly

Ordered in white these arrived quickly, wrapped in plastic with tags of authenticity. The fit and feel is marvelous and the price is sensational. Macy's and other stores sell 501's for twice this amount. The slim fit isn't constrictive nor are they pre-washed so expect a few washings before they feel like a second skin.

Highest Recommendation!",5,The Iconic 501 at a Superb Price You Just Can't Beat.

I ordered this SPECIFIC pair because of the washed out color... It says ""light"" stonewash and that is what I wanted. But what arrived was the regular stone-washed color; you know, slightly faded but not the ""light"" stonewash I wanted and they picture here. There were quite a few variations of stonewash to choose from, but I'm unhappy with this purchase as I already had a pair of the regular stonewash and was looking forward to something different. It says in the script of the product ""no control over color"", or ""colors will vary""... but if that's the case then just eliminate this ""light"" color and go with the regular that you are shipping!
I'm unhappy!",2,no control on color

I'm wondering if they save money by using less mat'l--making Levi's tighter, or...is it today's fashion trends dictating their behavior? Dunno!

I wanted a pair of jeans to wear with shoes as the 527 is the model i usually buy for the boots. In my opinion these are the perfect model that will match with loafers. I find the 527 to be too loose to wear with shoes.

They were 30 X 29, but when I measured the inseams they were  26.5 and 27.  also the legs seemed small in the calf area, and I weigh 132 pounds.

A lot of niche brands have come and gone, but they are more expensive, lower quality, and fad-based. Skinny jeans? Ornate pocket designs? Bell-bottoms? Have at it. These 501s never go out of style and they last a long time.

The cut seems to be a little smaller too, but enough for me to send it back for an exchange to a size bigger.

I went to a department store and tried on six pair of 34 by 29 jeans and they were all over the place.  Where is the quality control?  I understand that there is variation, but there was totally unacceptable variation.  For example the front pockets were off center as the fly was clearly closer to the left pocket and not centered.

B000YXC2LI,,"As a life-long 501s wearer here's my two cents:

About the fabric: several reviewers have complained that the fabric is much thinner than the original 501s. That's true. They're not paper thin, but not they're not like the originals. These won't last years like they used to. They're like any jeans you might buy from Gap, Old Navy, etc.

About the fit: In the old days they were ""shrink to fit"", or ""preshrunk"" these jeans are tagged ""Original Fit"". I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, but basically, they're preshrunk. They fit right out of the box. Order the size you'd normally wear. They'll arrive soft, comfy and ready to wear.

Some reviewers have complained that they fit ""snug"". Unfortunately, I have to disagree. In fact, Levis changed their ""secret sauce"" several years ago with 501s for the EXACT OPPOSITE reason Americans are fat they also changed the logo on the back pocket. If you'll notice, present day 501s logo have a deeper chevron than the originals. At the time of this design change Levi widen the seat of the pants to make room for our Big Mac eating behinds. Staggering, but true. I'm sure about thisat the time I ran out to stores and bought several pairs of the truly ""original"" 501s and that supply lasted me decades.

So, they may be snug compared to something else, but compared to the 501s of the 90s, 80s, 70s, and 60s, these jeans are looser in the seat.

Gave 'em 4 stars because the negative reviews are true: They're not the original. They're not as good but what is these days? This as good as it gets.",4,As Good As It Gets
B000YXC2LI,,I ordered two pairs of these and the price is very good compared to department stores in this area.  The quality is equal to that of the department stores.  Love them and order a third pair.  The fit is perfect.,5,Love them.

Myself, I like the reminder of my youth, when zippers were not that dependable and young guys liked the security of the four buttons there to sheild your bulge, even if you left one undone occasionally.  Young girls would notice that and you might get a sly look and a smile.  But, I digress, my love of button fly Levis will go on, past when I will need to comb my hair back on the way out of the bathroom, or even tuck in my teeshirt or worry the fade has gone on to some legit wear holes, earned from many wearings and washings.

I wore Levi's basically my whole life until the age of 40, haven't bought a pair of Levi's in 10 years but when I put them on they were just how I remember, they fit and feel great.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I have tried all types of jeans throughout my years but always go back to 501's. I like the fit, the button fly can't break like a zipper and they have a classic look. One of the things that is different from the ones I wore 30 years ago is all of the colors available now and what seems to me like different types of cotton for each color. Some seem more like a woven cotton and some like a knit. And the more like a knit that they are the more they stretch out when you wear them. You can wash and dry them and they fit fine but after an hour of wear, (sit down stand up bend and kneel) the butt is all baggy and stretched out and the legs as well but I guess this is the case with most jeans. When you wear a belt with them, the belt seems to ride up and cause a weird situation where it is above the waistline of the jeans and into your boxers. This is made worse with thin belts. I think a couple of more belt loops would help with this.. I never liked the big brown ""leather?"" size tag on the back either. It always looked like something that should be ripped off after purchase but of course it is not meant to be and is stitched on tight. I can live with that and as for the stretching out, I will by a size smaller next time.",4,They have evolved over time.
B000YXC2LI,,"good price and fit/look as expected. all my husband will wear, so always happy to find them at a reasonable price",5,just right

B000YXC2LI,,"I mostly wear Levi's 501 Shrink-to-Fit jeans nowadays and have for years, but I purchased a pair of pre-shrunk 501's because I liked the wash. The color/wash I purchased was called ""Aged Perfect"", which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures. The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.

Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.

The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past. Unfortunately, I'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501's. This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2"" too long. This isn't a huge deal, because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better, anyway.

Overall, I'm mostly pleased with them, but I still prefer STF's and probably won't be buying another pair of these anytime soon.",4,Compared to STF's

Fit- very tricky, I've worn them for years, so I know sometimes you have to try a couple pairs in the same size to get them right,.
I know  to go up a size from my regular size in other pants. The only issue is if you need a not too common size as I do, your color selection gets very limited.
I'm not sure some of the tricky sizing is the result of moving production  overseas or what.
Other then this sizing and quality control issue, 501's are in a class by themselves. There are 501's, and then there are all the others.
So let's give them five stars they deserve, but be aware that you might need a few tries to get that perfect fit.",5,Either you love 501's or you don't

No wonder they were under my feet when I put them on.  So, I have joined others who have criticized the quality of the fit. Maybe Levi Strauss thinks they can live on their reputation but such thinking can lead to ruin -- think Pinto, Wang computers.......

8 Dec 13:  I complained to Levis and they said I could send them in to be checked (at my expense) and if my complaints were valid they would replace.  Sent them (w/photo showing defective ones side by side w/2 pair I've had for some time).

B000YXC2LI,,"Levis 501 jeans fit body well, last a long time, and are comfortable.  Got some black ones this time, and they are a nice for an occasion that requires a cut above the regular blue jean.",5,Product As Expected
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I have been trying to get a few pairs of 501 Originals (which is not the shrink to fit variety) that fit me, and have found the sizing of 501 Originals to be all over the map for jeans that all were labled 32w x 36L or 38L. In varying degrees, all--ALL--had waists that were bigger than 32. And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall (one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize, that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up).
Some were a little longer than specified, some were a lot longer than specified (far as I'm concerned, that's a good thing: I'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings, than find that after a few washings they are too short).

Most had strange front rises that caused, in varying degrees, the dreaded codpiece bulge (which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both--the bulge is not always symmetrical--inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward); the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color, which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake, but the second pair was just as bad: the Timberwolf's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side: hideous!

As for the button fly--that turned out to be the best thing. I've found the button fly to be very comfortable, more comfortable than a zipper. The buttons are no problem once you get the knack of them and once the jeans are broken in.

My dimensions are 73.5"" tall and 160lbs.  And of all the 501 Originals I've ordered, the best fitting is the Dark Stonewash in 32x36.  But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much, I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L--and guess what: that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly.  I give up.

ADDITIONAL INFO: the different colors the 501 Originals come in, are not all made from the same denim weight.  If you go to Levi's website, you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there.  Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day.  It's only a bad if you didn't realize you were ordering it.

ONE MORE THING: 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans, which are 501 Original Fit.  The 501 Original fit will behave pretty much like all other Levis that are not Shrink to Fit jeans.  Many people reviewing these Original Fit 501s didn't realize they were ordering the wrong jeans.  Again, Levi's website explains the distinction.",2,Dark Stonewash: The Best of the Worst
B000YXC2LI,,"This is NOT my first pair and won't be the last. The 501 jeans have always had the best fit. I have tried other levi's but always come back to the 501. The colors can be really hard to see in the amazon pics, I ordered the Tidal Blue because it looked the most like a regular dark blue Levi.

B000YXC2LI,3.0,"I have bought and worn Levi's for 50 years. They were always almost impossible to wear out. Recently I was looking for a pair of 501's in black. I went to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, NY thinking they would have the real McCoy's. Boy, was I disappointed. They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax. I wouldn't even consider all the pretty reds and greens and blues. Levi's were always made for men. Now it seems they are mad for 'funny' men. Even the blue jean material felt thin and cheap. I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper. They don't have all the cuts and 'pretty' colors that Levi's do but if I'm buying jeans I don't want funny colors and weird fits. NO MORE LEVI'S!",1,No More Levi's
B000YXC2LI,,"These jeans look and feel great, I am just not that keen on the buttons (rather than zipper).

These jeans, now called ""Rinse,"" are the true, original, classic Levi's 501 jeans. If you are impatient, I suppose you can order the ""stonewashed,"" and you'll get the same thing, except already battered and faded. Okay, if that's what you want. Mine fade to the same shade over time. But mine last longer.

These true, original, classic Levi's 501 jeans do not come in white, or black, or any other colors of the rainbow no matter how fanciful and attractive the name may seem (Blue Mist? Timberwolf? Iced Glass?). You order something else, you are not getting the true, original classic. So don't complain if you don't get the true original classic. You didn't order them. You ordered something else.

I've just received two pair. Both hecho en Mejico. Both the same, thick, durable fabric I've known for decades. Both fit as they always have. Both are sturdily stitched with copper rivets around the pocket seams (and steel riveted buttons on the fly). Both are true, original, classics.

I see other reviews disparaging Levi's 501s. Some complain these have a button-fly, not a zipper. Well, duh. Such folk not only didn't know what they were ordering, they didn't read the item description either. Other folk, however, seem to think that Levi's 501 jeans should be the color of a rain-soaked chrysanthemum and still be ""original."" Hmmm. What to think of such folk?

From the crotch, 16 in. down, the left leg was 8.25 in across & the right leg was 8.0 in across - so there's the prob. - since the fit seems the same, the back of the leg fabric must be cut to larger to make up for the shortage on the front.

When I ordered Levi's, I expected a pair of jeans that were quality, not cheap THIN napkin material. For a man's pants, these had the material of grandmas old worn out stretch jeans. Total junk.",1,What the hell happened to Levi's?
B000YXC2LI,11.0,"Ok, so based on other reviews, people are ordering jeans online and are fed up with a poor fit. Even If you go to a Levis store and try on 2 of the exact same size jeans, they will fit a tad different. I do agree that over the years, Levis has changed its factories(Bring em back to America please! We need the jobs!), changed its fabrics, etc. Times do change, but these are still great jeans. Below is my experience buying 2 pairs of 501's from this listing on Amazon. I bought the Tidal Blue, and the Dimensional rigid. Both of them in 32x32. They arrive, and look awesome! I bought a pair of the FROGGY before these, and they were paper thin and wore out in a matter of months. Not to be detoured, I ordered the 2, Tidal, and Dimensional. The Tidal blue fit flawlessly to the size I expected them to be, 32x32. The weight of the jean is heavy and full like levis should be for good life wear. The Dimensional Rigid are another story. They were alot thinner than the tidal blue, and the waist fits more like a 30 or 31, and the legs fit like a baggy jeans instead of straight like the tidals.

All that to say, when doing a review, please make sure you specify which version of Levis you got, the weight, feel, wash, etc...Maybe we can reduce this thing down to the pair that fits like Levis should. I LOVE the tidal blue, hence 5 stars. And, just to be sure it was not a fluke, I ordered another pair a month later. Fits exactly like the others, and the wash and print is identical. Good job, Levis. I am buying another pair soon, just so I will have my favorite pair of jeans at all times! I wear them everyday of the week when able. the just keep getting better. I tried all the boutique jeans over the years. When its all said and done, its Levis for me. Hope this helps. -Cheers.",5,Get the whole story....TIDAL BLUE!

B000YXC2LI,,I seriously can not understand how these Levi 501 jeans are the best selling jeans on Amazon and have such high ratings.  Usually Amazon reviews steer me in the right direction but not this time.  These jeans do not deserve 4 stars....3 stars is a stretch.  The instant I tried these jeans on I could tell the fabric was cheap and not a normal thickness for jeans.  My other jeans from a different brand (but same price point) are much more substantial to the touch/much higher quality...these Levi 501s are so cheap they are almost stretchy like women's jeans when they want it hugging their figure.  That brings me to another point...these jeans are way too tight.  I'm a skinny guy and I did NOT like how skinny these jeans were through the leg...barely any slack and it's not like I have big legs or something.  The button crotch instead of a zipper is a joke too...hard to undo/redo.  Horrible jeans for the price....bad Amazon reviewers...first time you've conned me into buying something from Amazon and making me regret it.  I'll be sending back my pair and canceling the second pair that wasn't shipped yet.,2,Cheap fabric and way too tight for mens jeans

But no more....

The last dozen pair of these jeans I've purchased in the last 7 years have fallen apart within 2-3 months of purchase. The material is flimsy, the stitching is weak, and the belt loops have  pulled out of every pair. This seems to have coincided with the move to offshore labor, and the last  four I bought were made in either Haiti or Egypt, of all places. I have a few other pairs purchased in the mid 1990s that are still as solid as the day I bought them, and I'd be wearing them today if my waistline hadn't expanded by a couple of inches.

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"At first glance, these appeared to be a normal pair of pre-washed black 501s, with the familiar cardboard tags, however on closer inspection, the fabric was very thin, with a very un-denim-like texture, the rivets were black rather than copper colored, and most tellingly the red tag on the right hip pocket did not say ""Levis"". ALL genuine Levis have the red tag, and they ALWAYS have the word ""LEVIS"" printed on them. The jeans were also weirdly wrinkled along the front of the crotch and top of thighs, as though the wrinkles were deliberately induced, but the texture was sort of stiff and crackly. I'm pretty sure these are counterfeit Levis.

B000YXC2LI,,"I have been wearing Levi's jeans, including 501's, for much of my life. So I didn't read the details, just the size.  Who in this day & age wants a button fly instead of a zipper?",2,No zipper  to open and close fly
B000YXC2LI,,"now i bought this for a friend and he loves it, it fits great and would definitely be buying more in time to come, good jeans.",5,love this
B000YXC2LI,,Buen producto,5,Five Stars
B000YXC2LI,,"tengo 15 aos usando este marca y modelo pero nunca compre de egipto, me parece que es un poco mas ancho y deben tener mas control de calidad pues los orificios de los botones son pequeos.
I have 15 years using this brand and model but never buy from Egypt, I think it's a little wider and have more quality control holes because the buttons are small.",4,no me gustan los que fabrican en egipto I do not like that made in egypt
B000YXC2LI,,"36W X 30L is absolutely wrong. 36W is about 1 or 2 sizes under and 30L is about 3 o 4 sizes under the measures of the made in Colombia levis 501 that I have and love for many years. Bad thing, never buy levis pants online again. I will use this jean as a gift.",1,"The size is wrong,"
B000YXC2LI,,Did not realize these have a button fly. Wish it would have been more prominently indicated. Very disappointed. Will return,1,Disappointed
B000YXC2LI,,Levis 501....what more needs to be said.  Quality and fit just like the original.  I have ordered more since.  Best jeans out there and affordable.,5,As expected
B000YXC2LI,,"Well, these are definitely better than the 505's I bought a few months ago, but they're still not the Levi's jeans of a few years ago.  Compared to the 505's, these actually sit at the waist and are sized correctly.  The 501's also use a heavier denim than the 505's, 550's, etc.  The button fly was not my first choice, but this way I don't have to deal with the cheap zipper used in the current 505's.  Did I mention that Levi's are not the same quality product they were just a few short years ago?  The biggest difference between these 501's and the legacy 501's (and all other styles of Levi's jeans) is the missing belt loops.  There used to be 2 additional loops in the back, between the center loop and the 2 side loops.  Somehow they just don't feel right without those other 2 loops.",4,501 Levi's
B000YXC2LI,,"Well I guess Levi's just doesn't care anymore about there customers, only profit margin!
First they changed the 505's fit and tell me to get 501's for the regular above the waste fit.
Now there are only 5 belt loops on there 501 jeans. What's next plastic buttons to save a few more pennies.
I am done with Levi's until they change there mindset.",3,Less and less
B000YXC2LI,,"I have worn these jeans regularly now for about 2 months, they have been through the wash probably 5-6 times they are still incredibly stiff and very slim fitting. I don't wear skinny jeans, I don't like the feel of pants that are too tight - which these are. The saving grace I guess is that the color is a nice deep blue wash so they do look good but for a everyday pair of jeans which is what I was expecting to get out of Levi's these aren't really cutting the mustard; I have had much better jeans.",3,Stiff and tight
B000YXC2LI,,"Legendary quality of a 501 denim of Levi is still living in modern re-issue! Very comfortable fit, they sit so well!",5,Excellent stuff!
B000YXC2LI,,Levi's need to make additional sizes.  I purchased 38x32 and really need 37x32.  Are intermediate sizes available? Does anyone know?,4,need additional sizes
B000YXC2LI,,"Takes me back to a simple time and place. A time of innocence and simplicity. I love the raw
color of these jeans and will cherish the gradual fade.",5,Just like I remember
B000YXC2LI,,"For some reason I thought the 501's had a zipper, but of course they are button fly.  I am not a huge fan of button fly, but once you have worn them a bit the buttons are easier to work.  As Jerry Seinfeld said, maybe that area is not a good place for sharp metal teeth to interact!",4,Good old Levi's
B000YXC2LI,,"The material quality is great, the fit just isn't quite there. I have tried other 501's and they fit perfect, which is what convinced me to purchase the jeans.",3,not quite there
B000YXC2LI,,"Levi's 501 has always been my favorite. My size is pretty easy to find in stores so I don't need to order by mail, but this time I did as store pricing was pretty high. When 501 is on on sale in stores I rather prefer to buy them there as I get the opportunity to check the fabric, texture, stone-washing level, presentation etc. But this was a good experience too. The product turned out to be flawless, nicely made, packaged and shipped to my doorstep. So I am very satisfied.",5,"Great jeans, a good buy when you can't wait for store sales"
B000YXC2LI,,These are some good looking jeans but significantly tighter than other pairs of 501s that I own that are the same size.  I only bought the one make so I can't say if there are differences between different colors that are the same size.,4,Levi 501

B000YXC2LI,,Sure miss the old levi's. These new versions still fit great but are considerably thinner than the old. Stiching thread color is different not sure I like that. Hope they wear and last like the durable jeans I have worn for the last 35 years!,4,Haven't needed to buy new jeans for awhile
B000YXC2LI,,I think these jeans are great for those of us who are short and curvy. These jeans are the perfect length for me plus they hug my curves without being too snug. I would buy these jeans again.,5,nice
B000YXC2LI,,"These are definitely Levis. But.. they aren't as good as they used to be. Not the sellers fault. I ordered them, but in the future I'll be looking for a better made jean. It used to be I could wear Levis for weeks if I wanted, then wash and dry them and put them back on. The 'new improved' Levis tend to wrinkle up now. Never had this problem in the past. They also wear out much faster than before. When did this start? I began to notice it in the last 6 or 7 years. Now I'll look at Wranglers or some other jean. Levis, what happened to you?",4,Levis. Arrived in a timely manner
B000YXC2LI,,"Great product, great price,  and quick shipping.  Would definitely buy again and in fact i did.  Just be aware of the 501 name,  its not shrink to fit so you have to order them like normal pants.",5,Great old standby

B000YXC2LI,,I like the 501 jeans. The fit was perfect. Levi's are the best and I am sure these jeans will last several years. Some people are put off by the button fly. I actually prefer it to the zipper fly.,5,The best Levi's jeans!

B000YXC2LI,,These are the preshrunk button fly jeans that fit at the waist.  I needed them to shrink a bit and have washed them 12 times in hot water and still they are a little big in the waist.  Too bad nobody sells jeans in the odd number waist sizes.  Still my wife loves the look.  Very happy with this purchase.,5,Great jeans; great price
B000YXC2LI,,"I am amongst the hundreds of people who hate the fit change Levi's made to the 505's. The old trusted ""standard"" fit zip fly 505 was changed to ""regular"" fit, including a drop in the waist. I agree that the lower rise waist is a deal-breaker for those who prefer a straight leg jean that fits ""at the waist"". My solution, just get the original fit 501! It's just a great normal fitting jean for normal guys. Yes, the button fly is a bit of a pain, but well worth the trouble to have a jean that fits like my former old favorite, the 505. Plus, my wife is happy, she says 501's are what hottie's wear!",5,Pant's for those who hate the new 505's.
B000YXC2LI,,"First, these jeans are quite comfortable. But.... I didn't read the description closely enough. When I hurriedly put them on preparing to leave the house for an appointment I was taken aback to discover that they had a button fly. I just went with them figuring that since I wore this type when I was a kid (before zippers were firmly established), I can deal with it. We'll see how that plays out. I do prefer ordering online since it is a 60 mile trek to go to the ""big city"" but sometimes being able to look closely before purchasing can be a good thing. Oh well.......",3,My Bad
B000YXC2LI,,"I was afraid that these would be different once I received them.  To my surprise, they were perfect!  I made my husband try them on right away just to make sure that they fit just like the ones he already has.  The price was great and the fact that they were delivered to my my door...so convenient.",5,Exactly What I Was Looking For

After wearing a few times now they fit much better, so I am glad I was patient.

Well after a month and a half of wear I have a hole in the jeans in one of the seams. Very disapointed in the quality of these jeans now. I bought 2 pair so hoping the other pair last longer.

There is the soft stuff that looks like jean that is not (the type used in women's jeans) and the heavier canvas.  The light stonewash I received was the heavier canvas.

B000YXC2LI,,"Reason being I tried them on in the wash I ordered (and even then I probably just got lucky). Been wearing 501s forever but I only own one, maybe two pairs at a time. I wear them until there's nothing left, then get another pair. Right now I've had one pair for the last two years. They've never seen a washing machine and are only OCCASIONALLY rinsed off in a cold tub and left to drip dry. (Say what you will about hygiene but I'm left with the most comfortable, best fitting jeans this way.) Unfortunately nowadays you can pick up four or five pair of Levi's in different colors and washes, all marked the same size, and you'll find that a few are super baggy, and a couple are so tight you can't even fasten them, but MAYBE one pair will fit like an old glove. Buy that pair and you won't regret it.

Kind of makes buying online impossible, which is extra annoying since the places in town that sell them mark them up to almost $80 and then run a ""sale"" that puts them around $10-15 more than the prices on Amazon, and even those places only carry a few washes/colors.

I'm giving five stars to my particular pair of trusty old 501s. I sincerely hope I can find another pair as good.",5,Only fit as expected for one reason

B000YXC2LI,,"I love 501 jeans, they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper.  Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean (there is a plain black 501 as well).  The polished finish produces a shiny, more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean.  If that happens, the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water, wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.

The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the ""give"" in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes.",4,Neat Appearance but tight fit

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"There are Levis and then there is everything else. Jeans should have the Levis stitching, tab and patch on the back or they are simply something else. Having said that, buying Levis is not easy. The styles are named with numbers, but over time the shape of the jeans changes. Today's 501s are not the same shape as 501s from a few years ago, and my 501s are much wider below the knee than the photos of 501s on Amazon or on Levis.com. Not the same at all. And I bought mine in the Levis store in Beverly Hills where they cost more money, and I still had to try on several to get the right size, and the sizes printed on the patches is only a rough guide.

Most reviews here focus on the offshore production and quality issues. I have not had any quality issues with any foreign made Levis so far. But I have had issues with sizing consistency, which is why buying jeans online is not worth the trouble of returns and exchanges. Sort it out in a store's fitting room before you ever buy them.

Today's fashion is for a slimmer jean, but if you try a 514 Slim Straight you will see that not only are they slimmer, but they also have too much fabric at the butt and they want to sit lower, and the pockets are too low. 505 Straight Fits, which in theory should be la lot like 501s with a zipper, are completely different from 501s. The 505s that I tried, while all slightly different in shape, all had a bizarre flare at the outside of the thighs, a much narrower leg opening, a slimmer lower leg, and again, they want to sit at the hip and give you a big empty space at the butt. The pockets are so low that your legs look a foot shorter. Not attractive at all. Perhaps if your thighs, hips and buttocks are more plentiful and curvaceous the 505s may fit more normally. They may be called Straight but they are not for straight figures, quite the opposite. You need fat and curves to fill them out. 505s fit quite terribly for my figure, except for the black ones, which share only the name 505 with the denim ones.

So the age-old classic 501s still flatter the typical male form the best, despite being quite wide-legged by today's standards. But again, if you have saved your old jeans over the years, you will clearly see that 501s are always changing. The waist rises and falls and tapers in and out in relation to the hips, the legs widen and narrow, the pockets get larger and smaller and higher and lower, and further apart and closer together, and only the name remains constant over time. And no revision warnings are ever issued.

One other reason to try on and buy in a store, 501's come in many colors and almost no two are made from the same fabric. There are so many different weights of denim, each with a different fit, that you have to compare the fabrics by standing, sitting and squatting in a fitting room. So take a quiet weekday morning off, go to a department store or a Levis store, and invest an hour or more to find your next great Levis in the stack of unpredictability. Buying online is unlikely to get you that perfect pair.",4,"Don't buy online, try on several in a store."

I love my 501's, so am know wearing my old one's instead of my new one's because they fit so much better.  The old one's are at least 15 years old, most are older than that.

Needless to say if I knew that these jeans had buttons instead of a zipper on the fly I wouldn't have purchased it.

B000YXC2LI,17.0,"I have been wearing 501's since I was a kid and these are quite inferior to the 501's I purchased several years ago. I have 5 pairs of these new 501's all less than two years old. Every one has split in the crotch area after about 6-8 months. I used to get 4-5 years out of a pair and usually they only wore through in the knees. As other reviewers have stated, they seem cut shorter in the waist so that I have to pull them up every time I stand up. Also, the denim seems of much lighter weight material to which I attribute the splitting in the crotch area. 501's used to be made in the USA with very heavy weight denim but these are sewn in Honduras and feel like cheap copies of real Levis. Used to love the fit and wear of 501's but guess I am going to have to try and find a new brand of jeans. Makes me sad as these used to be a great American-made product.",2,Not like the old 501's

I had to do some stitching work on them in order to make them fit as the black one, for the short problem I had to live with that ;).

The jeans fit perfectly and are without any defects - contrary to what I have been told from sales associates that work in Levi's stores here in the SF Bay Area as to why Amazon.com can sell Levi's under $50 and Levi's Retail Stores can't.  It seems that only the best of the best jeans are sold in the retail stores -- well that may hold some validity for others, but I have not found it to be the case at all - in fact - I have had problems with my ""full price"" purchases of 501's at the retail store and no problems after multiple purchases from Amazon.com.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Levi-s-Men-s-501-Original-Fit-Denim-Blue-Jeans/dp/B0018OR118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Levi's Men's 501 Original Fit Denim Blue Jeans</a>&nbsp;Well Done Amazon!!!",5,Perfect Fit and Look

B000YXC2LI,,"Last year I received 2 pair of Levis made in Haiti, I did not get them from Amazon.
Thet were so terribly constructed that I thought they were knock-offs. Any way the stitching in the rear end ripped 8 or 10 inches. There was also an issue with the room around the buttons on the fly, they did not give sufficient room to manipulate them. I threw them in the trash, a $100 loss. I have been wearing Levis for 50 years and never have seen such poor quality.

This year I bought 2 new pairs from Amazon and the were also made in Haiti. The have the same button issue, have loose thread ends everywhere, and the thread is different colors in different areas. I am going to give them a try, but will always be paranoid that the rear end will rip out. Never had to worry ever before!!!

The bottom line is that I am going to have to go the mall to purchase any more jeans, maybe they will be Wranglers

PS I contacted Levis and all they did was send corporate stamped out replys to me and said they could no guarantee that if they replaced them they would not be Hatian made. DO NOT ACCEPT LEVIS MADE IN HAITI",1,Haitian Levis are terrible
B000YXC2LI,,"It has been 15 years or so since I have purchased new jeans.  They were just not in my wardrobe and my old one got me through the odd occasion I needed them.  I had tried on numerous brands, sizes etc and came back to these every time.  For me, they fit just right, sit where I like them to and are comfortable out of the package.  If my past experience with these holds I will buy a couple more pair and then be done again for a decade or so.",4,Just like it used to be
B000YXC2LI,,"Heads up on the fit (regular, original, etc) descriptions. Unclear why Levi's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles (501, 505) but they did. What you used to buy is not what you're getting. Couldn't find a notice or explanation on any Levi's site, so you're on your own.",2,Watch out
B000YXC2LI,,"This will be the last pair of Levi's I purchase. Just to give some frame of reference for the 1 star, I'll go over a few things which have led me to abandon the brand all together. This is the third pair of Levi's I've purchased new in the last year and a half. The first two pairs have worn out beyond wearable use in less than a year and have ended up in the trash bin. I have no assurance that these will last longer than that either.

The fit and style of these are strange. They fit me around the waist but around the thighs and crotch they are much too small around my thighs. The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.

As a comparison of how terrible the quality of Levi's have become over the last few years, I had a pair of Levi's 501 that I purchased at age 16. They were beater jeans, worn in regular rotation until I lost them during a move a couple of years ago. Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.
These won't last more than a year and the fit is just uncomfortable and awkward.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the last time I will ever purchase Levi's jeans. They no longer have my trust.",1,Goodbye Levi's.
B000YXC2LI,,"I started wearing 501's over 40 years ago, loved them then, and love them even more now.  With all the jeans available and changing styles, 501's are a classic and the only jeans you'll ever need.",5,Old stand-by
B000YXC2LI,,The ones labeled stonewash have the fit and feel that I expect.  The other color options I've tried don't meet my expectation for 501's,5,Stick to the Stonewash
B000YXC2LI,,THESE ARE NOT REAL LEVIS.  THEY ARE MADE IN EGYPT AND DO NOT FIT PROPERLY.  THE MATERIAL IS NOT THE SAME AS THE MATERIAL YOU BUY IN STORES.  DONT BE FOOLED.,1,They are NOT real Levi's
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"It used to be Levi 501s could be trusted for their quality, but Levi 501s sold today vary in where they are made, in how they are cut, and in the material used. In limited sampling, it seems the ones made in Mexico are truest to the original Levi 501 cut and denim. (I'm concerned only with the medium stonewashed style here). The jeans made in Egypt and Haiti differ in the material and sometimes in the cut--the cut can be quite bad--big in the seat or high on the waist. The original Original 501s were fantastic and relatively uniform in cut with nice soft denim. Today, the Mexican-made 501s are nearly as good as the original Original but even subtle differences appear here, such as one leg being slightly longer than the other. The Egyptian and Haitian are simply not good--the material is not soft and the cut is typically off the mark. And buying over the Internet, it's a crapshoot as to which ones you'll receive. Your best bet is to buy in a brick-and-mortar store, where you can look (and try on) before buying.",2,End of the 501 era
B000YXC2LI,,"After all the reviews I read, and the ones my friends told me, I am confused. These 501 shrink to fit jeans shrunk about one inch in the waist, and about an inch and a half in length exactly as advertised and exactly as the first ones I got in the first grade in 1962. These jeans are not as tough as they used to be but neither am I. They will last for me just fine. I can not beat Amazon's price around here unless they are on sale, and not everyone's sale. I ordered them on the ninth and they arrived on the eighteenth. I guess I am spoiled by Amazon because I usually get my stuff faster than that. I guess all in all the whole deal was as good as it always is. The jeans fit perfectly when I got them and after the wash they were a little tight, but after I wear them some they will stretch back to perfect, same as always. The last Levis I ordered came from Mexico, these came from Haiti and there was no difference in the quality at all. I will order them again.",4,Still good jeans

I then tried on an old pair of 30 inch waist jeans and they were tight but I could button them.  So... I took a tape measure and measured them, they're less than 30"".  I've read this situation has become a common problem with Levi's but it had never happened to me.  Since most of the stores I shop at now carry Lee's and since I can no longer trust Levi's sizing... I've bought my last pair of Levi's.",1,Levi's not what they used to be.
B000YXC2LI,,"I ordered two pairs of 501s via the Internet recently. I was shocked. One pair was so small I can't button them. Another was way oversized. Also got a pair of 514s and they were of such sheer fabric, I can't imagine them lasting more than a year, even with infrequent wearing.

I guess the message is to make the trek to the mall to buy Levi's. There, you can try on 40 pairs to find one that's right.

It's really disappointing.",1,Really awful

I have a grey color, dark blue, and a light blue pair of these same pants. They all fit different. Does Levi's have a quality control department or not?

I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin.

The good part is Amazon's ability to take back a failure such as this.  I grew up in 501s and have always found them to be comfortable and tough.  Now, they're just comfortable.

The seams did not come apart.  It was the fabric.  Originally, fabric was so thick that they were hard to wear before being washed.  Even after washing, I could stretch the pants vertically and hold them from the bottom.  The fabric was that heavy.  Now, it's like gauze in comparison.

Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not ""feel"" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality.

After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down.  Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use.  I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon.

Mostly Levi's 501's, some going back to the late 80's. Eventually I got to the point I needed a waist size < 31 inches and needed to buy new jeans since, sadly, I had given away my really OLD jeans from the 70's thinking I would never wear them again (advice -- NEVER throw away or give up your old Levi's, no matter how beat up they are). So I bought a pair of the hard to find 29X34's online here (made in Mexico). Fit is GREAT. Build quality is good. The material -- not as heavy as the material I remember from the 70's or even the pairs from the 80's I still have. I expect they will hold up okay though. For the price, I think they should go back to the heavier material. I mean, $50.00 for a pair of jeans is a significant investment. I may go back to wearing Wranglers again for this reason as they are HALF the cost of Levi's and fit/look just as good. I do really like the Levi's brand though and may order a second pair via Amazon (since 29X34 is so difficult to find in the stores).",4,"great fit, material not as good as I remember from the 70's"

I ordered a pair of 501s only to find what I had anticipated: build quality was crap (the stitching looks like third graders did it with a knitting needle (actually, that's probably not far from the truth)), material was thin and reminded me of the cheapos that typically end up on clearance racks), the fit after one wash was absurd.

I did not have to worry whether the material on the 501 was heavy duty, it always was.  I didn't have to know that a 501 is ""classic fit"" (which I purchase) verus ""straight"" (which falls off my swelling belly.  Now, however, I need to figure out what jeans fit, what color ""snap pop"" or ""clean fume"" is.  Does the Levi Strauss company have a marketing/market research department?  If so, I suggest firing them, hiring back your old advertising agency, make your jeans (yes, re-install the meaning behind the word ""jeans"")the same, dependable way they were classically made.  Remember the lessons learned with ""new Coke"", messing with an icon isn't wise.

Otherwise, split off a Levi Strauss Classic and just make 501 jeans in the US by traditional, classic standards.

So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.

Now the comment about going to Penny's. The last pair I bought there (501's are the only thing I buy there) seemed to be heavier material. Washed 501's seem to have a lot of size variance, so trying them on is good. Second, the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash.  These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings.  Almost looks dirty.

B000YXC2LI,,"Last year I got a new pair of 501's here at Amazon. After 13 months (worn maybe once a week), they ripped at the crotch. Conveniently, this was just past the replacement deadline.

What kind of 501's rip? I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. I was on my knees, painting a baseboard, went to move a foot or two down the wall and ""RRRRIP"", two inch tear in the crotch. I needed to get the work done, so I kept going. Within a half hour the tear was about 8 inches long starting from the bottom of the fly to half way down my thigh.

BUT. I give 4 stars instead of 2 because they discontinued the version I had, ""Quartz Stone"" color, which was a much thinner fabric than other 501's I've bought in years past. That's the trouble with ordering online, even Levi will sell you junk sometimes and you don't know until it's at your doorstep. As a matter of fact, I went to Kohls a few days ago and got a new pair of 501's, with much sturdier feeling denim this time. The fabric color is either Dark Stonewash or Rinse, I'm not totally sure.

My new ones are as follows: unpolished rivets that are half-finished brass (look like brass on the inside, steel on the outside) and say ""L.S. & Co. - S.F."". There are 5 steel fly buttons (4 medium, 1 big) that have a mild patina and say ""Levi Strauss & Co. S.F. Cal"". Bronze stitching, traditional ""certificate"" printed on inside pocket, as well as the usual brown trademark stitched on the back, though they changed the stamped style/size to printed (not as cool in my opinion, but nobody will ever notice). Size is 34x30, actual is 34.75x29.75. Fit is perfect, not too baggy not too hipster (straight leg).

I am talking about the original non shrink to fit ones. the pants I ordered are very different in material and sizing as pants I bought last year, which I really liked, the sizing on new pants seems to be odd, slightly shorter leg length and smaller waist size from my last year 501's and other brands of pants. I am a usually a 30x30, but I had to return the pants 2 times due to unsatisfied sizing, 1st I ordered 31x30 but those didn't work, next I ordered the 30x32 but these pants will come on Friday.

The new fabric is stiff, doesn't have the nice ""drape"" of the real Levi's product we knew, holds wrinkles out of the washer, and does not age into that nice softness I remember. What in the world is Levi's thinking ? Instead of a quality product, we get pouffy names (""clean rigid"" ?) for an endless selection of dye types.

They used to take ages to make a pair look worn-out (which I thought was cool back then), and that was while I was climbing trees, skateboarding, what-have-you.  Times have changed.  Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?  And unlike some of the people commenting about the risks of buying mail order, I'm talking about jeans I bought from a shop.

B000YXC2LI,,"Levi 501 jeans are the only jeans for me and Amazon has them here for a great price.  I take a size 42 waist which most stores don't carry and Amazon always has them in stock.  The shopping experience here cannot be beat.  First for the product -  the jeans themselves.  These are indeed original Levi 501 jeans.  Some here seem to question that.  It's easy to question a product you get in the mail when there aren't shelves of the same item surrounding you to compare them with.  But 501s have a different feel than other styles of Levi jeans.  The same as with trying them on in the store two jeans of the exact style and size can have a slightly different fit.  Jeans have always been this way.  And wih some sites shopping on line can be a hassle but with Amazon it is very easy and user friendly.  They encourage returns if the jeans do not fit correctly.  So if you do experience that rare occurence where the same size fits differently (or perhaps you even put on a little weight) if tags are intact you can return them free no questions asked.

So here on Amazon I can get the high quality 501s that I love for no other jean fits me so comfortably with a low waist that gives me the perfect look I want.  And with Amazon and my needing the larger size I can shop till I get the ideal pair.  Highly recommend the awesome 501 jeans as well as the shopping experience on Amazon.",5,Excellent jeans at an excellent price

B000YXC2LI,4.0,"Two years ago I ordered 5 pairs of Levi's 501 jeans. These ""Shrink to Fit"" are great.
The issue I have is with Levi's product naming ccombined with Amazon's page design that obscures whether a ""color"" is ""Shrink to Fit"" or ""Standard Fit""

Using the link from my previous order I was sent to Amazon's generic Levis 501 page. Doing some research on the us. Levi web site, it appears that Levi makes 501 in both ""Shrink to Fit"" and ""Standard Fit"". The Amazon page that was linked to a previous order does not distinguish which ""color"" is ""Shrink to Fit"" and which color is ""Standard Fit"". This makes ordering the proper size very difficult.

Amazon has a ""Shrink to Fit page"" page, but in the generic ""Levi's 501"" page I cannot tell which _colors_ are ""Shrink to Fit"" and which are ""Standard Fit"". This attribute should be part of the ""Sizing"".

The product is good is you get the fit you expect. However, the combination of Levi's product naming, and Amazon putting ""Standard Fit"" on the same page as ""Shrink to Fit"" without disclosing which color is which fit, makes it problematic.",3,Levis Product Naming and Amazon Page Design Issues

Last time I was in Germany at
Chemnitz in a Levis shop. The sold black pants were full of white yarn, now
I ordered a 501 in Hungary and I got one whit a textile weave error.
The reason I could not order at Amazon.com is, that there are restrictions
from Levis it self! You should know, that the product is more expensive in
Germany or Hungary then it is in the US!
The pants are costing between 70-90-s over here in Europe! I do not think
this is the right quality for that price!

The quality of the jeans themselves is fine, but the inconsistent sizing is ridiculous and frustrating.
I've ordered Levi's 501 jeans online numerous times, and they've always fit. I've suggested that they measure the waist size before they package and send them to the customer.

B000YXC2LI,,"My wardrobe is 501's. I fashion all my accoutrements around them.  When I have to dress up I can use black 501's for the opera or kaki with a white shirt for the office. However I have always chosen my work environment for its fashion taste in stone washed 501's. Do not tell anyone but I take mine to the cleaners and have them dry-cleaned and pressed (no starch), just crisp and casual at the same time; it is an old habit from my military days. Come to think of it the military used button fly's also.

 I can see the problem of purchasing online vs. store bought is that they use obscure words as ""rigid"" in place of gage (or oz.) Not one did they mention the tab color which is Levi's way of sorting the Mercedes quality version from their Yugo (lighter weight but still from Levi) version. And yes they are subject to globalization which in this day and age is a ""no no""; and there is no way to tell without looking at the label. Well enough of this negative stuff.

An advantage of on line is getting those obscure colors and exact size (saving a tad in tailoring). Also saving gasoline (sort of an expensive commodity now days) and time.

For instance, I bought a pair 4 months ago (sadly, the last Levi's I'll ever buy) that ripped after getting caught on the corner of a desk. Any of the earlier pairs I have were put through much worse abuse (hunting in South Texas [thorny mesquite trees-dense brush], hiking/camping in New Mexico mountains, working in a truck repair shop) without any noticeable damage like a big rip.

The price has gone up even though they are clearly using lower quality denim. At ~$40 they're just not worth it. I never owned CK's or Jordache because Levi's looked just as good, were more durable and cost 50% less. Now, if I'm going to spend $40 for jeans, they might as well be CK's since those are clearly made of higher quality denim at least.

It's possible that the other ones just shrank more than these, but I've washed these in HOT water 2 or 3 times. They're not getting any smaller.

Aside from that, they are lightweight, comfortable, button-fly, and fade into a greyish charcoal-y look that I really like. When I sit they kind of push into my stomach uncomfortably unless I pull them up before sitting, and that's kind of annoying, but I don't know if that has more to do with my body shape or the way they are cut.

So, I finally bit the bullet and made the trek to Macy's.  Tried on 4-5 pairs of identically marked jeans and they were all over the map.  Found a pair that fit.  Washed them once and they turned into floods.  Returned them and got another pair.  Washed them and they're ok.  So, I'm done with buying jeans online.  And I'm probably done with Levi's.

I say ""probably"" because this assumes I can find anything any better.  The market provides what the consumer demands, and apparently what the American consumer demands is cheap, useless junk.  As other reviewers have observed, the current version of Levi's denim is shameful.  Not only is it thin and non-wearing,  but since it shrinks along one bias more than the other, it is important to orient the fabric in the machine correctly.  Apparently, this is too much to ask.  Ditto for getting either the waist or the leg to match the label.

Bottom line:  My advice is, if you're going to buy Levi's, don't do it online.  It just doesn't work.",1,I wouldn't.....
B000YXC2LI,566.0,"I have been buying the sized 501's (not the Shrink-to=Fits) for my husband for nearly 15 years.  Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.  Levi's just are not as good as they used to be and any one who says differently hasn't been buying them or wearing them as much as we have.",1,Just not as good as they used to be

Until this week, I had been wearing levis all my life and in recent years was only wearing 501's for all occasions. I buy many different colors for my various activites. Currently I have over 10 pairs that have never been worn because there is no quality control at Levi Strauss. Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs. One last issue I have is that the material does not hold up. some of the 501's I bought in recent months rip after wearing them just a few times, some of the buttons come apart.",1,"Label says the same size, the fit says otherwise; ever thinning denim"
B000YXC2LI,2.0,"I agree with some other negative reviews that this fabric is either lighter weight than the 501s are in the stores or it is lighter weight than they used to be (which is certainly the case). However, I'm not working in construction and I'm not sliding down dirt paths on my knees so I haven't seen this to be an issue. The fit is very comfortable, what I am familiar with from buying in the store.

The color ""Medium Iconic"" is nice and similar to what I would consider a regular unadorned denim color. It has a slight lined pattern which you can see in the extreme closeup of the product image. However I would say there is a slight differrence that is not discernable in the product image. In real life, the line pattern appears to be more vertical than side to side. Also, there is a slight faded wear pattern on the front of the thighs so that it appears slightly lighter there, but it's not so pronounced as to be ridiculously false and trendy for the sake of it. I do think the subtle lined pattern adds some style to the jeans, but like I said about the fading, it's not so dramatic as to scream ""Hey! Notice my fancy jeans!""

If you're going to be subjecting these jeans to heavy wear, then maybe don't get these, and instead go buy some Dickies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dickies-Men-s-Relaxed-Fit-Double-Knee-Work-Horse-Jean/dp/B000N8Q5IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dickies Men's Relaxed Fit Double Knee Work Horse Jean</a>). The fit of these is true to what you expect. And ""Medium Iconic"" is a stylish (subtly) version of a standard blue jean color.",5,"Medium Iconic, Weight, Fit"
B000YXC2LI,2.0,I've always like 501s but I'm thinking that Levi has cut corners/costs and gone to a lighter weight fabric so they wear out faster.,4,Almost the same as always

You said shipping would take a few days.  WRONG - I got it in two days and packed well.

I am totally pleased and put me on your mailing list as I will be ordering again.",5,And you said

B000YXC2LI,2.0,"These Levis 501 are black.  After two months of washing, any damp cloth will still pick up black dye.  Also, the right leg has been cut and or stitched on a bias, so that the seam runs in a spiral down my right leg.  The seam on the left leg runs properly down the side.  Further, they fit oddly - bagging under my butt and tight in the thigh.  Something is odd and not right about them.",3,"""Original"" Levis disappoint"

I have worn Levi jeans for about 30 years. I have never had any even come close to the amount of shrinkage as in the pair of Levi's  that I purchased through Amazon. I never got to wear them a single time. I tried them on the day that they arrived and they fit perfectly-just the size I ordered. I hung them in my closet for about a month, took them out and ran them through a COLD water wash. I let them tumble in the dryer for about 10 minutes and them line dried the for the rest of the day. I cannot even get them on. I tried to give them to my son who wears a 34 waist ( the jeans are 36 waist) but he can't get them on either. They now measure 33 at the waist. TOTALY RIDICULOUS !!!
They are about 2 inches shorter than before they were washed in the cold water. I would usually give Levi jeans a high reccomendation but not these. It must be some wierd fabric from a different supplier.",2,amazing amount of  shrinkage
B000YXC2LI,,The jeans material could be better and it doesn't fit fine (at least for brazilian). Color is ok.,3,Doesn't fit
B000YXC2LI,22.0,"I was surprised to find that these original 501's are not so original. The cut may be the same, but these are made from a lightweight denim. I think it's only 11oz, much lighter and less hardwearing than the original. Great for summer wear, but don't expect these babies to last anywhere near as long as the 'original' originals. Levis really need to think about clear labeling, the 501 originals now seem to have several variations. These only got 3 stars because they aren't what they pretend to be, they're a lightwieght fashion version of the real thing.",3,501 the original Levis?
B000YXC2LI,644.0,"Real 501's are made of 14 oz canvas-like material.  These ""Iconic Rigid"" jeans are made of some sleazy, much lighter material that takes on a carefully contrived set of wrinkles to make them look like they'd been worn to bed soaking wet and dried out overnight.  If you want real 501's stay away from these.  I sent mine back right away.",1,NOT 501's!
B000YXC2LI,,"I'm not sure if it is only me, but somehow I could not ask anyone at amazon about when a particular jeans will become available. All my jeans are Levi's 501s, and among them the color Dust Storm is my favorite. I've been checking for over a month now and 501, dust storm is not available in my size at amazon.com. The more annoying is, there's no information on if and when it will become available. Do I have to come back and check every week to see if a new shipment has arrived???",1,can't ask anyone when a particular jeans will become available
B000YXC2LI,216.0,"I normally buy my husband's 501's at the mall but went this route because I was short on time. HUGE mistake. The material is totally different than any pair he owns and there are a lot of little differences that make me think these are knock offs. These jeans went straight to the work jeans pile because they are just weird in fit, color everything. They were also not much cheaper than I would have paid from a real retailer. I will not buy 501's again unless they are from trusted chain retail store.",1,Not department store jeans.
B000YXC2LI,,"If you look on the tag on the back of a pair of Levi's you will see that they started on May 20th 1873. Luck will keep you going for a few years, but Quality and consistency is what keeps you up and running for over 100 years. Levi's have been a staple of my wardrobe for almost 40 years and I don't see that changing any time soon. They fit, feel good, and last for years.",5,Levi's was there any doubt?
B000YXC2LI,5.0,"WTH?!? Total rip-off! Bought two pairs of these ""jeans"" and they shrunk about two sizes and I'm not sure what the material is but it isn't what use to be comfy Levi 501 cloth! If you are into the wrinkled look these jeans are for you... it is proving to be absolutely impossible to get the massive wrinkles out of these pants.

I am very disappointed with this purchase and am feeling VERY cheated by the Levi Strauss Company.",1,These are NOT Levi 501 jeans!!
B000YXC2LI,,"Decent price for jeans but, when I received the package the pants inexplicably smelled of crab meat. After a wash, they fit well, though.",4,good fit
B000YXC2LI,,I'have recently bought these jeans. Shopping online pants without a proper try is always difficult but it looks like that you can rely on Levi size calculator. Though finding that perfect pair of men's jeans is never easy. Delivery was fast and I was surprised how dark they are (more than pictures show). Actually good design makes it acceptable even to our company dress code so I wear them whenever I can. I am very comfortable with a great fit. So all in all - smart looking jeans with a nice fit and very dark blue color - exactly what I wanted:),5,Smart looking jeans

After all, if it wasn't what I wanted, I could return it without charge. The packages I received was so light that I thought there was nothing inside.

Are these real Levis 501's or knock off's ?They are made in Mexico, his older ones are made in Colombia and are regular heavy fabric Levi 501 work pants.

I dress comfortable. So I dress really casual. I don't think I've ever worn out any other pair of jeans at work. But I go through about two pair of Levi's a year. Worn out in this case are small holes so the jeans are able to be recycled for work on the farm. Again, comfort is a premium. Should you wear Levi's 501's? It's all a matter of taste. I have it, and I must say that when I used to do office work, my bosses didn't. I had to work overtime to gain Casual Day Certificates to wear 501's. Really, it was worth it. Did I say this yet?

B000YXC2LI,6.0,"I was very unhappy with this purchase; I will no longer purchase clothes from Amazon.  I was looking for a pair of shrink to fit jeans in my hard-to-find size.  The Amazon web page that came up advertised Levi's 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the size, and I proceeded to select a pair.  The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit.  I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised.  The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.  However, the online resolution screen haughtily claimed that since the purchasing error was my fault, Amazon would not pay for the shipping.
