"If I had wanted blue burlap sack, I would have looked for it. Levi now thinks they can flog off any material on their customer.

"I normally don't do reviews, but this time I have something helpful to say so I thought I'd share it.  The Verde Rigid is actually a Shrink to Fit jean and is not ""Pre Shrunk"" like it says here on Amazon. I bought my normal size, 30x30, washed it gentle cycle in cold water and dried in low heat. It came out super shrunk!!

Then I looked online and found this:

Made with rigid denim that you wash to a perfect fit and finish. Keep it dark and clean by washing as little as possible, or fade it with gentle washing. Will shrink approximately 10 percent; size up 1"" if waist is between 27""- 36"", size up 2"" if waist is between 38""- 48"". Increase length by 3"".

But since I am really a 30x30 and they don't make 31x33, I debated whether I should go 31x32 or 31x34. They also said somewhere if you wear boots, add an extra inch, so it would be 31x34. I don't wear boots and I wear these jeans when I ride my bike, so I decided to get 31x32. I hope they turn out cool.

Oh also, I called Amazon, and they were totally cool with it and issued me a full refund although I washed the jeans and it shrunk like crazy. They need to move this to the Shrink to Fit section.

Also, even though these jeans shrunk like crazy, they still kinda fit although they are kinda short in the inseam. They fit kinda tight, but the quality is great! They are super rigid and durable, I've never had a pair of jeans like this! I read somewhere that when you get your jeans, you should shrink them by taking off the tags, putting them on, and getting into a bathtub full of hot/cold water (depending on color of jeans and extent of fade you want). You sit there for about 30 minutes and when you get out, the water should be all blue and you will have a custom fitting jean! I will try that on my next pair instead of throwing them into the washer and dryer. Because I left them in the dryer for 2 days, they came out super wrinkly and they stay that way!! It's better for them to conform to your legs than all your other clothes in your dryer!",5,"5 Star Quality, but these are Shrink to Fit!!

"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

It finally occurred to me to try the obvious, and check out the men's department instead. I'm overjoyed to discover that men's standard Levi's 501s fit me just fine, and look the way I expect jeans to look. They have pockets, and belt loops big enough to fit a normal belt, and legs that reach all the way down to my shoes.

"I've been wearing Levi's since I got out of diapers about 46 years ago. I have bought my last pair. The quality in the last few years has been terrible. These jeans now have a serious problem with belt loops just suddenly ripping off. My last five pairs (two just purchased in the last month) have done this. I even had a pair that I purchased directly from levis.com a few months ago that the loop ripped out of and when I went to repair it I found that it and one other loop had already been repaired once (I didn't notice the patches while I was wearing them, who looks inside there?). They must not have passed QC at the factory and were ""fixed"" before being sent out. Just last night I took off one of my new, less than a month old pairs and found a belt loop hanging off and the tell-tale hole. No more.

"The 501 shrink-to-fit, button-fly jeans have undergone some radical changes. The pocket socks are shallower and the material thinner. The denim is not as heavy, and the once durable stitching is now a hit and miss operation. The structure of the 501 has changed. Gone are the engineered (7) traditional belt loops, which now number only (5). Only one back-centered belt loop exists now, leaving an 8-inch span between the belt loops on either side. Note pic. The black Levis are from 1997, and the blue Levis are from 2018.

postscript: The black 1997 Levi's (w/ black stitching mind you, not the ""Filipino"" orange/gold stitching of today's versions) are 33 x 36 and fit perfectly. I just ordered a 501, shrink-to-fit Rigid Blue pair in 34 x34, and as expected, Levi changed their sizing, so if you want them to fit, then order one size larger than normal in the waist, and the next size shorter in length than you would usually order in a 501. They're a little baggie in the seat now, but far from the ""marble bagger's"" of their size 33 waist offered today. So, waist size up, and length-down and you might be happy. Levi's still are missing the two back belt loops, so cut some off of an old pair and have them sewn-on like I did. Boy Howdy. Hoop jumping to buy Levi's.

"This is basically about overall quality.  Over the years I have watched the quality decline in every aspect.

Inconsistent workmanship.  One used to be able to count on one pair of jeans being the same as previous pairs.  Not the case anymore.  In my last three orders of multiple pairs of 501s, items in the same order were inconsistent.

The fabric gets thinner every year.

Right rear pocket attachment point develops a hole over a short period of time.  I do not carry anything in that pocket.

A pair of Levi's would last years.  Six months is considered amazing with today's product.

These are made in more countries that I can begin to count with some of the worst quality control and workmanship that I could document using ISO9000 standards.

Bottom line.  Overpriced junk.  This is the last time I will deal with this company who was based on quality in the past but has lost their commitment to the primary factor that made them great.  Time to try Wrangler once again next go around.  Ordered them in the past and went back to Levi's after the thinner material seemed cheap.

Levi's has myriad different levels of quality, now. 501's are *not* what they were when one could only buy the ""raw"" cloth type, and had to wash 'em five times before they were comfortable.

We've found some great buys at stores where we could examine the merchandise.

"I've been wearing 501s for a couple of decades and after this pair of jeans I'm done. The cut is different (more skinny jean like), sits too low and the fabric feels super thin and soft.

I'd own two to three pair the newest of which might get worn to the office on a Friday and the older ones used for outdoor work. This new 501 is no good for either. Too low to wear to the office.

"UPDATE - Yeah these are garbage.  They are Levi's in name only and don't carry the quality you'd expect.  These are going back and my hunt to find a reputable denim company to replace my 505s continues!!  I'm only rating 1 star so i can leave a review.  Otherwise they should pay me for the time I've taken out of my day to review their garbage.

I'm not impressed at all with these 501s.  Normally I wear 505s and when I say normally I mean I have 1 good pair of jeans that i wear regularly, they are old, they are ""broken in"" and they are Levi's 505s.  I've lost some weight recently so i decided to purchase a new pair of Levi's and went with the classic 501s.  Wow the quality seems to have really taken a dive.

These Jeans are stiff.  No, not like new jean stiff.  I'm talking I could stand them up on their own without any support.  While unfolding them I joking thought to myself ""these jeans are so stiff they might crack!"".  Stiffness aside, the jean material feels much cheaper than my previous pair which have been worn hundreds of times and is still a much better quality than these brand new 501s.

I've washed them twice in a effort to get off the extra die and to try and loosen them up.  They still feel crunchy and stuff.  I'm going to wear them around a couple hours to see if them relax and break-in at all.  If not, these are heading back.",1,Skip Levi's and go with another brand ... the quality is really down the tubes,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,neutral,0.914210975,0.0361,0.01087,0.03249,0.566227436

"I've been wearing Levi's since I could fit into them. They were the jeans back when I was a kid. I was so sick of Sears Toughskins because they had the reinforced knees that looked like somebody had stuffed a piece of cardboard in there. They screamed ""Your Mom is Practical!"" Levi's, on the other hand, were cool. It was what the hippies and fishermen wore. I'm talking about the early 1970s in Alaska. I grew up in that alternative lifestyle, one where if you wore a sport jacket, it was used. And you wore a paisley shirt, maybe some work boots. You rolled your own cigarettes and the other stuff, too. So anyway, I'm a fan. I remember wearing Levi's to work everyday as a reporter at the Anchorage Times, may that great paper rest in peace. And I still wear them, except now I work for a rural weekly waiting for technology and the economy to send all us old reporters out to pasture. Of course, I also wear slacks, LL Bean khakis. But the Levi fit is second to none. I tried Lee again but was dissatisfied. Higher waisted. Baggier. I had some Lees that rocked back in fourth grade but got battery acid all over them and they disintegrated. Batteries die at 30 below zero and you have to muscle them inside to warm and charge. I wore the same size 501s for years. I'd wash them several times so they'd soften. But now I'm old and wider. I wear 36 waist and 34 inseam. I wear a belt.

I have not ever written a bad review for any item received on Amazon but I couldn't let this go. These 501s are the worst purchase ever. I cannot believe how cheaply made they are. I've worn 501s all my life (54)years and never have I had a pair like these. THIN. They were a little tight then after I washed them I couldn't even get them on. All my other pairs fit fine so it is not the post Thanksgiving swelling. I will never buy Levis online again. If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear. I wouldn't expect them to last more than a few months of washing because of how thin they are made. I am wholeheartedly saddened if this is the quality that Levis has sunken  to.

"I have been buying Wranglers because they are cheap. Some last over a year. Others have something like a belt loop failure after 6-12 months. It's a little annoying, but I figure that's what you get for buying cheap jeans.

Recently I decided to splurge and get a pair of Levi's. They looked great and fit great. Since they were my ""fancy"" jeans, I did not wear them for yard work or anything, just two days sitting at a desk and one wash every week.

Imagine my surprise when, after six weeks, the belt loop failed! About two weeks after the return window closed.

I suppose I will figure out some way to patch them, but they sure aren't my ""fancy"" jeans any longer.

I thought I could buy more expensive (assuming higher quality) stuff and buy and discard it less often, have better stuff and help the environment a little.

"501's used to come so stiff due the thickness of the fabric you had to wash them 20 times to get them to loosen up so yer legs could bend.  These showed up like I'd already had 'em for a year.

The inseam seemed a little short as my other 36"" inseam Levis are much longer...you guessed it...I measured the inseam...33 1/2"".  Now that's OK because they'll work with sneaks or boat shoes. but too short for boots.  I realize what I got sent DID state they were the correct size.

"I've been wearing Levi's jeans for 30 years. The last time I bought a few pairs online the fit was off (too tight in some areas, loose in others). I though it was just a fluke. However, when I received the most recent pair, I found more quality issues. In this case the back pockets were sewn on so low that they are on the leg of the pants! The 501 jeans are supposed to be low rise but these reach much higher.

Apparently the Levi company closed their US production plants and now manufactures their jeans in Asia and Mexico. The result seems to be slipping quality control. The pair I received were produced in Mexico, however other reviewers have had similar complaints about jeans made in Asia. I highly recommend buying these in a store where they can be checked for quality and fit. For at least the first 20 years of buying these, I simply grabbed them off the shelf in my size and never had to worry about trying them on. I knew they were what I had been buying all along.

"Bought a 501 Rinse 40/30; received an Egypt made pair that's not even close to being a 40, at best a 36. Rough around the edges, badly finished...

I had bought Levi's before here on amazon, on the big famous auction site and on different brick and mortar stores around the world and I had never seen a pair like these.

I wish I could return them, but I had them forwarded from the USA to my country and sending them back would cost more than buying them again. An absolute waste of money :-(

I attach photos to compare this 40/30 to a rarely used 36/30 made in Mxico (same size!) and a 38/30 also made in Mxico but with a bit more use (the Amazon-purchased 40 looks like 4 sizes smaller than the 38!!!)",1,Made in Egypt.... for aliens or something.,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,neutral,0.838242114,0.02027,0.0068,0.02027,0.278157651

First off, the material doesn't feel nearly as dependable as they use to, being someone who works outside all year, they feel like they could get holes in them very easily. Also the quality of the jeans, on receiving the jeans, the tan tag was sewed on, like any other jeans, but this looked like a defect as the brown tag went far beyond the seams and looks very cut up.

"Ok I didn't even know they still made Levi 501's! Let me begin at the start. I was diagnosed with advanced stage IV cancer and I was told to fatten up as much as humanly possible or risk dying from the very aggressive daily regimens of radioactive & chemotherapy which would eventually cause me to despise food to the point of not eating a thing for 2 1/2 months! My lead oncologists team of physicians all pleaded with me to begin eating anything or suffer having tubes surgically implanted into my stomach for nutrition. So cut to now, I survived my therapy but not without coming way too close to death due to lack of nutrition as well as the lack of use of my digestive system. Now I seem to be able to eat whatever, whenever and I still can't keep the weight on. This has been both a curse and a blessing. The curse is of course for obvious reasons but the benefits have been wearing clothes that I never thought I'd be able to pull off let alone put on ever again! I'm wearing sizes that my body hasn't seen or felt in 25years. My wife and I have an inside joke that keeps the seriousness of what we've been going through together due to cancer and it centers around the fact that although I'm far from being out of the woods due to this deadly killer, I'm not looking like one would think after gaining all that extra weight, almost dying three times, having visible signs of radiation burns on the exterior of my skin and then losing all the weight. I'm not being conceited but I look like I did at 24years old and am wearing the same sized clothing, especially in the area of my waist, so buying new pants and having them fit comfortably as well as look great is definitely an ego boost! So the joke is, I'm the poster boy for cancer because it agrees with me lol anyway thank you for reading this far into my rant as it's turned out rather than a review. The Levis 501's feel great! They fit as perfectly as they did when I wore them for the first time back in the 80's Dont pass up a chance to get a great pair of jeans to show off that great pair of genes you've been blessed with!",5,"Fits like an old glove!

"I'm sure I'm old school. For instance, I value my time. I imagine a lot of people do. Which is why they invented zippers. Zippers really are incredibly handy. Imagine you've got to catch a bus in just a few moments. Then nature calls. Well, it's a quick matter to take care of things and get out there to the bus.

But, the new graduates of (Fill in the Name of Your Favorite Prestigious Business School) have decided that they have a better idea. Don't they always? Replace the zipper with not three, not four, but five separate buttons to close the fly. This does not include the button where the belt comes together (which, assuming the Prestigious Business School taught them had to use both hands to add) comes to a total of six. Of course, you don't really need to undo the topmost button to take care of business. But, the whole arrangement of the buttons being fastened into an inner last just complicates things. It really is a pain in the fly.

And, really, why? The cute (I'll give them that) buttons aren't visible, so are meaningless. They aren't particularly easy to fasten (if easy at all). As William Shakespeare said when he tried these on: Much ado about nothing.

I agree with the reviews of many others. These are the last Levi's I buy. Stick with what works. There's a reason flies have zippers.

"Since 1954 I have worn 501 levis the fabric got lighter the quality less today I went to buy some the button fly button holes were raveling improperly stitched to reinforce the button hole the buttons appeared ""tin ey.  The holes were not going to hold up.  The lighter weight fabric & poor quality forced me to look at others none have same fit. At 75 I bought my first Wrangler original fit [with a zipper.

"Had to send the 1st pair back, a button on the fly came off.  In the 26 years I've been buying 501s, I've never had that happen.  Even to really old, well used, maybe a little to tight (I swear the pants struck and I was the same size), pairs.
But Amazon replaced them,  so that's cool of Amazon.
The fabric is a little different than my other pairs,  not sure if that is because of the color I picked (and how they process the color) or if it's some cost savings measure so they can lower the price.  Either way,  I just expect more from my 501s,  they have a rep to keep after all.",2,So-so (from long time 501 wearer),NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,neutral,0.513274848,0.02381,0,0.02381,0.541146934

"Easy shopping. Got what I wanted without having to search through piles of Levi's trying to find the style I wanted in my size. If you are not familiar with purchasing Levi's based on their sizing policy, I recommend actually trying on several pair in a store and to confirm if they are pre-shrunk or shrink-to-fit.",5,Easy Shopping,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,neutral,0.830094695,0.02985,0.01515,0.02985,0.432428598
