"If I had wanted blue burlap sack, I would have looked for it. Levi now thinks they can flog off any material on their customer. The last time I ordered these levis I got something in stripes that looked like I was escaped from prison. Now it is burlap!

"I normally don't do reviews, but this time I have something helpful to say so I thought I'd share it.  The Verde Rigid is actually a Shrink to Fit jean and is not ""Pre Shrunk"" like it says here on Amazon. I bought my normal size, 30x30, washed it gentle cycle in cold water and dried in low heat. It came out super shrunk!!

Then I looked online and found this:

Made with rigid denim that you wash to a perfect fit and finish. Keep it dark and clean by washing as little as possible, or fade it with gentle washing. Will shrink approximately 10 percent; size up 1"" if waist is between 27""- 36"", size up 2"" if waist is between 38""- 48"". Increase length by 3"".

But since I am really a 30x30 and they don't make 31x33, I debated whether I should go 31x32 or 31x34. They also said somewhere if you wear boots, add an extra inch, so it would be 31x34. I don't wear boots and I wear these jeans when I ride my bike, so I decided to get 31x32. I hope they turn out cool.

Oh also, I called Amazon, and they were totally cool with it and issued me a full refund although I washed the jeans and it shrunk like crazy. They need to move this to the Shrink to Fit section.

Also, even though these jeans shrunk like crazy, they still kinda fit although they are kinda short in the inseam. They fit kinda tight, but the quality is great! They are super rigid and durable, I've never had a pair of jeans like this! I read somewhere that when you get your jeans, you should shrink them by taking off the tags, putting them on, and getting into a bathtub full of hot/cold water (depending on color of jeans and extent of fade you want). You sit there for about 30 minutes and when you get out, the water should be all blue and you will have a custom fitting jean! I will try that on my next pair instead of throwing them into the washer and dryer. Because I left them in the dryer for 2 days, they came out super wrinkly and they stay that way!! It's better for them to conform to your legs than all your other clothes in your dryer!",5,"5 Star Quality, but these are Shrink to Fit!!

"I've been frustrated for the last several years because it's gotten so hard to buy plain ordinary jeans for women. They're all full of fashionable features: superfluous zippers, patches, gussets, grommets, decorative stitching, little drifts of glued-on rhinestones. But at the same time, they're lacking some obvious things: belt loops, or a pocket big enough to actually hold your keys and some change. They don't come in regular blue or black; they all have weird faded patches which have been applied in special factories at enormous expense. And nearly all of them are unflatteringly, ankle-chillingly, hideously, four inches or so too short. I began to wonder if perhaps there might be some sort of vast international trouser conspiracy, run by sadistic clothing designers who sit in dimly-lit rooms waving swatches of fabric and cackling maniacally.

It finally occurred to me to try the obvious, and check out the men's department instead. I'm overjoyed to discover that men's standard Levi's 501s fit me just fine, and look the way I expect jeans to look. They have pockets, and belt loops big enough to fit a normal belt, and legs that reach all the way down to my shoes.

I bought a pair of these jeans from this seller a few weeks ago and am extremely happy. First off they are the only ones that offer some of the more rare finishes for this particular jean. For example the iconic rigid and new metal colors are extremely hard to find and they look extremely great. I picked a pair of both of these colors and got them for a great deal.

Love them. This is Second pair I bought from this company & both are perfect. Was very surprised because usually have hard time getting pants that fit right. I didn't wash first pair for a long time worried would shrink to much but still fit perfect after being washed now several times. I always liked 501's but cost is prohibitive but these were cheaper than JCP & JCP Didn't have a single pair of 32/32 that I could have tried on @ the store. So I took a chance & purchased online & all worked out way better & great for Me & that's not usually the type of luck I have. So 5 stars definitely earned. Ty,5,Love them.
